# FFN-DOWNLOADER

What can you do with this project ?

You can download any story from `fanfiction.net` (well, probably, I didn’t really tried that far, just with a few of them), just enter the link of the first chapter and it should works fine. If it don’t, report it please. ;)

This app works in a shell and aim to be able to run on Unix. For Windows, the `rm -rf` command won't work. Feel free to change it.

You can use it and redistribute it as you wish if you follow this conditions:

 - Don't pretend to be the original author.
 - Say the original author is Poliorcetics.
 - Link this repository.
 - Don't sell it or use it to make money.

Have fun !
