# FFN-DOWNLOADER

### What can you do with this project ?

You can download any story from [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net) (well, probably, I didn’t really tried that far, just with a few of them), just enter the link of the first chapter and it should works fine. If it don’t, report it please. ;)

This program is a shell program which should work (hopefully) for every major OS.

**This was not tested on any other system than OS X 10.11 and a RaspLinux image. I hope it works on Windows or other Linux but I didn't try. You can try though, I can't think of any way for this program to harm your computer, I certainly didn't want to create a virus.**

### Can I use it ?

You can use it and redistribute it as you wish if you follow this conditions:

 - Don't pretend to be the original author.
 - Say the original author is Poliorcetics.
 - Link this repository.
 - Don't sell it or use it to make money.

Have fun !

Note:

I only let online the more advanced version, since it is the more advanced version. Old versions are still on my computer but often broken because of all the changes I kept piling on them. So currently, version 3. Read the `README-V3.md` to know how to use it and such.
