<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p>Chapter 5</p><p><em>A/N: Sorry been a while had some GCSE revision 2 do</em></p><p><em>C IN MATHS :D SO NO REVISION TONITE SO HERE U GO</em></p><p><em>Thanks for the reviews but keep them coming.</em></p><p><em>This continues a few hours after the last one.</em></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Padme walked into her house on Naboo looking for her older sister Sola. She looked everywhere; all the bedrooms, the dining room, the kitchen and family room. She couldn't find her anywhere. In the end she asked her mother.</p><p>"Mother have you seen Sola anywhere I need to talk to her about something"?</p><p>Jobal Naberrie looked at her youngest child the surprise clear in her eyes. He two daughters got on better than most siblings that she knew. But not to the extent when they asked to talk to each other.</p><p>"No Padme she isn't here at the moment and I don't know when she will be back".</p><p>Padme sighed and Jobal could see her daughter looked disappointed. "But Padme you could talk to me about what you were going to ask her".</p><p>Padme looked at her mother in surprise. Did she really want to talk to her about it? She would have preferred to talk to Sola but she needed to talk to someone, and she didn't know when her sister would be back. She figured it wouldn't hurt.</p><p>She looked up at her mother and took a deep breath. She spoke in a soft but firm voice "I met a boy mother, the best boy I have ever met".</p><p>Jobal's eyes widened in surprise, of all the things she was expecting, it was not that her daughter had developed a crush on a boy. Then Padme carried on.</p><p>"He was so sweet. I saw him meditating by the lake and I walked up to him and we started talking. He told me about his life and I told him about mine. His eyes- she sighed- they were so green, they were greener than the grass in the garden. They seemed to star into my very soul. His hair was messy but in a good way and as black as the clearest night".</p><p>Jobal stared at her daughter in disbelief. From what her daughter had described this was not a boy she knew. She asked trying to sound as normal as possible "Have I or your father ever met him"?</p><p>A sad look crossed Padme's face and she shook her head. "No he isn't even from Naboo, he is from coruscant. But it wouldn't have worked out anyway he is a Jedi".</p><p>Jobal was stunned her daughter had met one of the legendary guardians of the galaxy but even more shocked when she saw her daughters eyes fill with tears. Her daughter never cried! She walked up to her and pulled her into an embrace and Jobal understood why. The Jedi law on attachment meant that a relationship would never work.</p><p>Padme moved immediately into her mother's embrace. She didn't like crying because she thought it made her look weak. But she had been under so much stress recently with running for queen, and meeting Harry had been the final straw. She couldn't control her emotions anymore she had to let them out.</p><p>Meanwhile Jobal felt sorry for her daughter because she knew due to the extent of her sadness this was not a crush. Her youngest daughter was in love, weather she knew about it or not. As her daughter sobbed into her shoulder Jobal knew she could only imagine the pain Padme was feeling.</p><p>Back in his room Harry was lying face down on his bed not moving but in deep thought. He was trying to work out his feelings for Padme. The trouble was whenever he got to any attachment that was more than friend; he furiously denied that he felt about her that way.</p><p>After a while of thinking but getting nowhere Harry sat up and hid his face in his hands. He was more confused than he had been in his life. Then he heard a knock on his door and Harry sensed who it was. "Come in master", Harry called out.</p><p>The door clicked open and Kit Fisto stepped in. "Harry what on earth are you doing here I have not seen you since breakfast". He was annoyed but his annoyance vanished when he saw Harry looked a bit upset not his usual cheerful and confident self. "Harry what's up"?</p><p>Harry looked at his master and then thought of a way Kit could help. "Can we talk somewhere else"?</p><p>Kit looked at him a bit sceptical but nodded and together they went to a room down the corridor with a table in the middle and a bookcase on the side. They sat down opposite each other and Harry took a deep breath.</p><p>"Master you don't have to answer this if you don't want to but what does it feel like to be in love"?</p><p>Harry saw his master's mouth drop slightly but he quickly straightened up. "Well Harry obviously I can't answer this properly as me and Aayla's feelings for each other are forbidden but I guess the main thing would be that I would do anything I could for her. If she had to face a deadly mission I would do it for her, I would get in the way of blaster fire for her and even though we are not allowed to be together, if she died I could not go on without her".</p><p>Harry looked at his master shocked by the depth of his words. He got up and nodded "thank you master, excuse me". He sprinted to his room and slammed the door. He flung himself down on his bed and punched the mattress in frustration. He was angry at himself. He thought of Padme and the words his master spoke to him and realised of Padme was faced with death he would sacrifice himself for her. If he could; he would try and keep her out of danger. He would do absolutely anything for her.</p><p>Like earlier he was convincing himself he was not in love. <em>No. </em>Harry thought. <em>It is just a crush I am not in love. All my life I have been taught not to form attachments. We can stay friends. Even if I was in love she is probably going to become queen and will probably be suited to somebody who has a normal life and a load of money. She wouldn't be interested in somebody like me. </em>He punched the pillow and pulled his necklace from around his neck. He looked at it and knew that he had a normal life before he came to the Jedi. He knew that he could leave and he could fall in love and could do everything the Jedi forbid. <em>No I will not abandon something I have been doing all my life because I fancy a pretty girl. </em> And with that he stood up and walked out of his room and went into the front garden to meditate.</p><p>Meanwhile Kit Fisto had watched his Padawan and immediately understood what was going on and it took all his self-control to supress a smile because of his weak attempt to hide it. But on the other hand he was concerned. He could tell from his behaviour that Harry had formed a deep attachment to somebody and he was furiously denying it. It was what Kit himself had done when he had fallen in love with Aayla. He sighed and vowed to keep a closer eye on his apprentice from now on. "God may the force be with me trying to keep an eye on him". He said with a chuckle,</p><p>The next day Harry was lying at the lake on his front, with his tunic beside him and his under shirt bunched around his neck letting the sun toast his skin. Then he felt a familiar presence and quickly sat up and straightened his shirt. He looked up and saw Padme and her appearance made him awe. She was wearing a red dress that was made of a light almost floating material; her hair unlike yesterday was put up in a tight bun with a few strands falling down and she had gold bracelets at her wrists.</p><p>"Hello Padme". Said Harry standing up, he went to bow but before he could, a set of arms wrapped around him firmly and tightly. For a moment he was clueless as to what was happening then he realised Padme was giving him a hug and he returned it lightly.</p><p>When she let go they sat down and started talking. After a while Padme looked at Harry and said "Harry where are you from"?</p><p>This made Harry's breath catch in his throat and his eyes grew wide. He looked at Padme and then at the grass and clutched the necklace around his neck. He wanted to tell her but the only person who he had told before was Dez. Not even Yux or Prelo knew even though he did want to tell them, and had come close in the past.</p><p>He looked at Padme took a deep breath and said "Padme I will tell you but first I want you to promise me that no matter how shocked you are when I tell you, you will let me finish and leave questions for the end".</p><p>Padme looked at him the confusion clear in her expression but she nodded anyway.</p><p>Harry took another deep breath. "Well Padme the truth is I didn't come from this galaxy or even this universe. I was born on Earth a planet inhabited by humans in a galaxy far, far away from here. When I was one my family was attacked by a murderer and my mum used the power she got from her ancestors. They invented portal travel to travel through different galaxies and universes. It is rarely used because it is very dangerous and my mum used a portal to send me to Coruscant, to be trained as a Jedi. She also wanted to save me from growing up on a corrupt world torn apart my war and death".</p><p>Padme's face was exactly as Harry knew it would be: white with shock. When she started trembling Harry got worried. Then she flung herself around Harry and gripped him tightly. Harry was shocked; whatever reaction he had been expecting it was not this.</p><p>Padme suddenly realised what she was doing and let go quickly. She looked at him sheepishly then said "sorry Harry, it's just I was shocked that you didn't get a choice about becoming a Jedi and war tore apart your family".</p><p>Harry shook his head "no Padme I did have a choice about becoming a Jedi, when I was four they asked if I wanted to become one and I did because I was strong with the force and it seemed pointless to waste it and I loved living at the temple and I love the life just helping people it makes me feel good".</p><p>Padme nodded but said nothing then Harry realised she was feeling guilty for giving him another hug. "Don't worry Padme". He said kindly "it felt kind of good". The last part slipped out and Harry mentally kicked himself.</p><p>Padme gasped silently, <em>he had liked her hugging him, even with the laws he had been brought up around. </em>Then she thought suddenly <em>shut up Padme it was just a friendly hug, he doesn't like you like that he can't. </em></p><p>Then a voice brought her out of her thoughts "Um Padme are you okay"? Harry asked with deep concern clear on his face.</p><p>Padme stared into his sharp piercing green eyes, etched with worry, the eyes that seemed to stare into her soul, the messy black hair that she urged to run her fingers through. She found her legs acting of her own accord and she took two steps towards him, and put her hands on his shoulders. Then she went up on tip-toes and pressed her lips to his. They felt warm and wonderful. She closed her eyes. She wrapped her arms around his neck and felt arms snake around her waist and felt the passion growing and then she felt his tongue against her lips and then a blast went in her mind <em>she shouldn't be doing this for both of them. </em></p><p>Instantly she pulled away and stepped back and looked up at him shock on both her faces. "I shouldn't have done that", they said at the same time.</p><p>They smiled slightly in spite of themselves then Harry spoke, "Padme I really am sorry", said Harry. The look on his face showed he truly meant it.</p><p>Padme shook her head "don't be Harry we both did it I should be more to blame I kissed you in the first place shall we just forget about it if you can"?</p><p>Relief instantly broke out on his face and nodded "sure Padme I really value your friendship and I hope this won't make things awkward between us".</p><p>Padme shook her head "No Harry it won't if we just forget it and act like it never happened nothing will change, I value our friendship too". She would never tell him this but inside the idea of forgetting it was killing her but she knew it was best for both of them.</p><p>Harry nodded "sure I agree let's just forget it". He would never admit it but the forbidden kiss had been the best moment of his life but he knew forgetting it was the best thing to do.</p><p>Then a shout came across the garden "Padme come on you have a speech to do".</p><p>Padme looked across and shouted back "coming Sola". She looked back at Harry "until tomorrow then Harry".</p><p>Harry nodded stood up and helped her up. They looked at each other "see you tomorrow Padme" said Harry and he bowed to her and she curtseyed back, and ran after her sister.</p><p>When she was gone Harry walked down to the lake and started throwing the stones over the lake hard as an outlet for frustration. He had been an idiot he should have stood back when she moved in, but he couldn't help himself he had lost himself staring into her soft brown eyes. He had loved the feel of her lips on his, but knew it would never happen again and he was well in the knowledge that it was wrong.</p><p>As he stared over the lake he had never been kissed before it but knew that wasn't the normal feelings evoked from a kiss from a crush. And as he mulled more over his feelings he stopped stupidly denying it and admitted that he Harry Potter was in love with Padme Naberrie and he had broken one of the most important rules of the code he had sworn his life to live by, in less than a year. He sighed and took a walk around the grounds and it was pitch black by the time he went into his room.</p><p><em>A/N: Hope it was good and got the romance bits well. I know Padme was OOC a bit but I hope it weren't too much. Sorry if you wanted them together now but this had to happen first like Anakin and Padme did in AOTC. BUT THEY WILL BE TOGETHER SOON AND AGAIN SORRY FOR THE WAIT. As always REVIEW</em></p>
