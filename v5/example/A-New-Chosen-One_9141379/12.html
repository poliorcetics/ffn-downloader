<h1>12. Chapter 12</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><P><em>A/N: Hope you guys enjoy this chapter hope I got it ok. It was probably the toughest chapter to write so far. Also I forgot to put this at the beginning of the story cut completely forgot, if you haven't figured out already Harry doesn't need glasses.</em></P><P>Padme leant against a pillar in the hangar. As soon as they had arrested the Viceroy, she and the group of fighters had gone back to the hangar to wait for the Pilots. Padme was also concerned for Harry and the other Jedi. What they had, had to fight looked terrifying. If Harry was dead she didn't know if she could handle it.</P><P>The Pilots had landed a while ago, but the fighters knew the Queen wanted to see if the Jedi were ok. Then eventually they heard someone coming. They quickly looked down the corridor and saw the Jedi. Padme let out a sigh of relief, then she realised something wasn't right. Evidently the others did too as there were no cheers of success. The older Jedi, Qui Gon Jinn had holding a bundle of robes in his arms. Padme looked behind him and she saw Obi Wan Kenobi supporting Harry who had a blank look on his face. Staring into space his bright emerald green eyes that she loved had lost their shine and were dull. Then Padme realised who was missing; Harry's Master Kit Fisto. She begged her suspicions not to be true but one look into Qui Gon's eyes told her they were. She felt a wave of sadness wash over her. She hadn't known the Jedi master very well, but she had seen Harry's admiration for the Jedi Master and had deep respect for him because of that. She had also heard a lot about him and knew that the Jedi Order had lost one of their finest duellers.</P><P>When the group of Jedi reached the fighters everyone bowed their heads and the remaining palace guards tipped their hats. Then Harry collapsed. The other two Jedi knelt down to tend to him and understanding came over Obi Wan's face. He stood up and looked at Padme. "He's exhausted from shock have you got a medical room nearby"?</P><P>Padme swallowed slightly but nodded. "Yes follow me". She went to walk out of the Hangar a few guards trailing behind her along with Obi Wan (who was carrying Harry) and Qui Gon. Then she turned to her hand maidens and remaining fighters. She looked at the decoy Queen and said "inform the Gungun's that the fight is over and then you are relived for the remainder of the day". They all nodded and everyone left the hangar.</P><P>Padme led the Jedi over to the medical unit and Obi Wan slowly and gently placed Harry down on the nearest bed. Qui Gon quickly placed Kit's body on a bed at the far end of the unit then the two Jedi collapsed onto chairs and Padme looked at them. "Master Jedi what happened to make Harry collapse"?</P><P>Qui Gon looked at the young Queen, "Your Highness if you saw your master struck down the way Harry did, if you don't collapse from shock you don't have feelings".</P><P>Padme paled at this, "How did he see it".</P><P>Qui Gon sighed and looked down, "We don't know exactly what happened but so far as we know Harry was less than a foot away and he saw his master viciously killed".</P><P>Padme nodded, "Very well I will leave you too to rest doubtless you are very tired. But before I leave if I can I would like to attend Master Fisto's funeral. He died to protect my home planet and I would like to pay my respects".</P><P>Master Qui Gon rubbed his eyes, "I am sure that won't be a problem your highness, but I will have to put it to the council's decision".</P><P>She nodded "Very well good night Master Jedi I am so sorry for your loss".</P><P>The two Jedi nodded to her and she left. After the door closed behind them Qui Gon stood up and pulled out his Holo-Projector. He activated it at the Jedi council showed up. Yoda spoke, "Master Qui Gon going on what is"?</P><P>Qui Gon bowed to the council and spoke, "Master's the viceroy has been captured and the invasion has been stopped. But I am very sorry to say that Master Fisto has been killed. Whatever killed him I have my suspicions to be a Sith Lord. It was well trained in the Jedi Arts and had clearly been trained in the dark side of the force".</P><P>Nervous looks crossed over the Jedi master's faces. Everyone looked at Yoda, who even he hadn't been alive when the Sith were last powerful but was alive and a Jedi around the time of restoring peace to the Galaxy, and rebuilding the chaos created by the Sith, and knew better than any other Jedi how to deal with this piece of news.</P><P>Yoda nodded, "Master Qui Gon, thank you for informing us of Master Fisto's death. Master Fisto's funeral have first, then discuss your suspicions we will".</P><P>The two Jedi on Naboo nodded. Then Mace Windu looked at them, "is his Padawan ok"?</P><P>Qui Gon sighed quietly, "As you can imagine he is very distressed. But from what I can tell the boy is strong I am sure in time he will be ok".</P><P>All the masters' nodded then Yoda spoke again, "Discuss new master for him we will after the funeral". Then Yoda looked at the two Jedi, "Meet you on Naboo for the funeral we will,</P><P>Qui Gon bowed his head to them, "Of course masters see you on Naboo". The council nodded to him and the connection broke.</P><P>The two Jedi collapsed down into chairs. It had been a millennium since Jedi had fought the Sith, and they knew that if they really were back it could lead to the destruction of the whole Jedi order like it almost did last time. Qui Gon looked at his apprentice, "Obi Wan if you want to rest you may, and I will stay with Harry".</P><P>Obi Wan shook his head slowly. Then Harry stirred slightly and sat up rubbing his eyes. The first thing Obi Wan noticed like Padme was that his eyes were not the bright emerald they usually were.</P><P>Harry sat up properly staring into his lap. Then he muttered slowly and quietly, "It was my fault".</P><P>Qui Gon and Obi Wan shook their heads. Qui Gon spoke, "No Harry, it wasn't".</P><P>Harry nodded. "Yes it was if I had got back up to the fight sooner he would probably still be alive".</P><P>Obi Wan shook his head, he knelt down on the floor beside the bed and put a hand on Harry's shoulder. He looked at him eye to eye, "Harry listen to me; it was not your fault. It was ours and the Jedi councils, if we could have sensed that there was a Sith Lord here, they would never have sent a thirteen year old on the mission".</P><P>Harry found some sense in that but spoke, "How am I the chosen one if I can't even defeat one Sith. I almost died if it wasn't for you two I would be dead. How can I be the one who is meant to bring balance to the force"?</P><P>Obi Wan and Qui Gon looked at each other shocked. Had Harry really expected himself to be able to beat the Sith completely at thirteen?</P><P>Obi Wan looked at him again. "Harry listen to me. You are the chosen one but you're not ready yet. You're still only a Padawan. You're going to need much, much more training before you can destroy the Sith. You will probably be a knight if not a master".</P><P>Harry thought about what Obi Wan had said. It was true, he was being stupid. Had he really thought he would be able to destroy the Sith before he was even an adult. "You're right I'm just being an idiot".</P><P>Obi Wan smiled. "And Harry, you managed to put up an excellent fight against a much more experienced fighter. You nearly defeated him. You severed his lightsaber in half and probably could have beaten him if he hadn't stabbed you. Now c'mon I can tell you're exhausted, just go to sleep. You will feel much better in the morning".</P><P>Harry smiled slightly and settled back down onto the pillow and fell asleep minutes later. The two Jedi looked at each other and smiled. "Well done my young Padawan you handled that extremely well". Obi Wan smiled in appreciation of the compliment.</P><P>After a night of troubled sleep Harry woke up to see sun streaming through the windows of the medical unit. Not feeling remotely tired he slowly climbed out of bed and walked to the shower feeling depressed. He couldn't look at his master's body. He knew that if he did he would just blame himself again. He walked to the end of the ward and scrubbed himself under a scalding hot shower.</P><P>After the shower Harry felt much better. He felt more awake and didn't have a dull ache in the pit of his stomach. His head also felt much clearer. After braiding his hair and dressing he walked out of the ward.</P><P>Harry took a walk over Nabbo's sunny garden much like he had on the previous mission. The sun helped him focus and he found the heat comforting. Eventually he found himself in his usual spot by the lake. Harry sat down and used the force to skip rocks across the lake, anything to distract him from what had happened the day before.</P><P>After a while he just sat by the lake watching the water shine in the sunlight, making the rays bounce off the water making great effects. Then Harry heard a voice he longed to hear. "I thought I might find you here".</P><P>Harry turned around and saw Padme standing there in all her glory. She smiled at him and sat down beside him and looked straight into his eyes. "Harry I am really sorry for what happened to your master. I never really met him, but I could tell he was a great man, I am really sorry".</P><P>Harry nodded, "thank you, he was a great man, he taught me so much". He looked away from her and stared out across the lake. "I miss him, I always will. Whoever they give me for a master know has some big boots to fill".</P><P>Padme smiled and nodded, "I know they will". She paused for a moment, then looked at him, "Harry"?</P><P>Harry looked at her, "yeah"?</P><P>Padme took a deep breath, "Harry I just want to say, thank you for saving my home planet. If you and the Jedi hadn't defeated what you were fighting. I think we would all be dead now, I am just sorry it came at such a cost".</P><P>Harry smiled. "No Padme while it is sad when you train to be a Jedi you know that whatever mission you go on. There is a chance you will die, it was just a shame it had to be my master this time. It could have been any of us. Me, Obi Wan or Qui Gon, but it was my master". Harry left out the part that he had almost died too.</P><P>Then Padme looked at him. It was killing her knowing what she had to do, but it was best for both of them. "Harry look, we both know how we feel for each other, but I think it would be best if we went our separate ways. For both our sakes. You are leaving in a few days and are training to become a Jedi, I am Queen. If we stayed together I think it would destroy us".</P><P>Harry nodded slowly not hiding the sadness, on his face. "You're right Padme. I couldn't live a lie like that and I know you couldn't either. It would destroy us".</P><P>The two stood up and Harry bowed to her he couldn't help but notice he was standing in exactly the same spot he was when they first met. Padme curtseyed back and looked at Harry. "Well Harry good luck becoming a Jedi, I know you can do it if Naboo ever gets invaded again you will be the first person I call".</P><P>Harry smiled slightly. "Good luck with being Queen Padme. In fact you better be a good one after all we went through together". Padme smiled slightly knowing he didn't mean it in a bad way. As she turned to walk away Harry muttered something but she heard it. "Know this Padme Amidala, I will never forget you and I will always love you".</P><P>Padme felt tears come to her eyes. She <em>really</em> wanted to run back to him, hug him kiss him and tell him she will love him forever and that no one can take his spot. But she knew if she did, that would be their last thoughts of each other and wouldn't do them any good. Taking a deep breath and summoning all her courage, she walked back to the palace desperately fighting off tears.</P><P>Harry watched her walk away. He sighed slowly and turned back towards the medical unit. He felt sadness washing through his body worse than when his master was killed. He knew then that this confirmed that he felt real love for her. He sighed again and decided to take a walk round the garden. There were guards everywhere and everyone looked on edge. Harry walked round the palace once more then headed back to the medical unit.</P><P>When he got there he saw Obi Wan who was dressed and drying off wet hair he smiled when he saw Harry. "Good morning Harry, how are you feeling today"?</P><P>Harry shrugged. "I am ok, could be better but could be worse. I took a walk round the garden you know clear my head".</P><P>Obi Wan nodded "I understand. My master is talking with the guards about Kit's funeral. The council are arriving later today and the service will be held tonight". Harry nodded. Obi Wan looked at him. "I can only imagine how hard this is. Have you eaten yet", he asked. When Harry shook his head Obi Wan smiled. "C'mon then let's go get some breakfast, food will help". Harry smiled. Now <em>that </em>was something he could agree with.</P><P>The council and other Jedi arrived late in the afternoon. Harry saw dozens of Jedi get off, then he saw the three he really wanted to see. Dez, Yux and Prelo. They walked up to him and they each shared a brotherly hug. Prelo, spoke first. "Harry we are so sorry for what happened. Master Fisto was an amazing Jedi and a really good man". The other two nodded. Then Dez spoke.</P><P>"Harry, you don't have to answer this if you don't want to but is it true you fought a Sith Lord"?</P><P>Yux shot Dez a glare but Harry laughed lightly. "Its ok, that's what Qui Gon and Obi Wan think. But the Sith have been extinct for a millennium so I think the council highly doubt it". The three friends nodded in understanding. Then Mace Windu came over to them.</P><P>"Young Padawan", he said looking at Harry. "I am so sorry for the loss of your master he was a great man and I will miss him". Then he addressed them all. "We brought some clothing traditional for a Jedi funeral, so take these and get dressed met us in the temple. A guard will show you to it".</P><P>The young Jedi nodded and sprinted off to get changed</P><P>After changing the boys looked at themselves in the mirror. Harry was wearing a long black robe with accents of green. He didn't like to admit it as it was quite uncomfortable. But it looked good on him. Dez was wearing the same robe as Harry but it was white with accents of red. Yux had navy blue with accents of white, Prelo had dark grey with accents of black. As Mace Windu said there was a guard waiting for them who showed them to the temple.</P><P>It was a small round building with a block in the middle where Kit's body would lay. Harry stood next to his friends and Qui Gon and Obi Wan. Soon all the Jedi who had come to Naboo. Then Padme came into the room with her handmaidens and some guards, there was an astromech droid there, for some reason. Then the body was brought in.</P><P>Harry couldn't look at it. The body was laid on the wood atop the block. A Priest came over and performed a blessing. Then the fire was lit. Harry watched as his master slowly burned. Even though they hadn't been partners for a long time Harry had learnt a lot.</P><P>Harry looked around. Mace Windu and Yoda were talking in hushed voices. Harry wondered about what but was too consumed by grief. All the other Jedi had their heads down. Then he looked at Aayla Secura she looked in near tears, Harry knew he would have to talk to her later. Then he looked at Padme she was staring straight into the fire. He looked away quickly. Then he just put his head down.</P><P>After what seemed like an age the funeral was over. After they milled out of the building Harry saw Aayla walk down to the lake. He excused himself from the others and ran after her. He saw her sit down at the lake and start to cry. Then she spoke looking up at the sky, "KIT FISTO YOU BASTARD! WE WERE MEANT TO HAVE TIME TOGETHER AFTER THE JEDI ORDER AND YOU GO AND DIE. I HATE YOU!"</P><P>Harry walked up to her, "Aayla"?</P><P>She spun around, "Harry what are you doing here"?</P><P>Harry sighed and sat down beside her. "Aayla, look I know how you and Kit felt about each other, he told me. You don't hate him you're just clouded by your feelings".</P><P>Aayla looked at him. "I loved him Harry, that's something you can't understand unless you experience it. And seeing as you're the chosen one I doubt you would break the Jedi code".</P><P>Harry shook his head, "Sorry Aayla but I have experienced love. I am in love with someone right now. I know its love because I would die for her if I had to. I would face a thousand blasters for her".</P><P>Aayla looked at him seeing nothing but truth in his eyes. She grinned slightly despite herself. "So who has caught the heart of the one and only chosen one hmm? Would it be say, who's that girl from your old clan umm, oh Akaso?"</P><P>Harry nearly burst out laughing, "WHAT! NO! Don't get me wrong she's a great girl but she's more like my sister that someone I would like in that way".</P><P>Aayla frowned, "So who is it I can't think of anybody else".</P><P>Harry smiled, "Well I am not telling so there". Then they heard a shout, "Harry Aayla c'mon were catching the ship back to Coruscant".</P><P>Harry stood up and pulled Aayla up with him. As they walked back to the ship Aayla looked happy. Harry smiled too, it looked like they were both on the way out of the depression of Kit's death. As the ship took off Harry knew he was leaving behind the best and worst times of his life.</P><P>A/N:<em> Hope this chapter was good. If you think that Harry will develop a crush on Aayla NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I will admit they were easy to write together, and really fun but Padme and Harry have better chemistry I think. And Aayla is WAY too old for him! In the next chapter hopefully I will thicken the plot and Harry's new master will be revealed. Please Review.</em></P>
