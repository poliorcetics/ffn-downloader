<h1>13. Chapter 13</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p><em>A/N: I will be skipping some years like George Lucas did but I will be making it sooner than in the cannon series. This Chapter goes start right after the last one.</em></p><p>As soon as the ship landed on Coruscant, Harry split from his friends and went straight to his room. He thought he saw Dez trying to go after him but Prelo stopped him. Harry smiled slightly; Prelo was good at understanding how people felt. As soon as he reached his room he dropped his bag and collapsed onto the bed. The images of seeing Kit struck down by that ruthless monster started running through his head, as though they were deliberately tormenting him. He pushed away the feelings of sadness. He had already betrayed the code, he would not do it again. Out of respect for his master if nothing else. He rolled over onto his back and stared up at the ceiling. He knew that tomorrow he would get a new master. He had no idea who it would be, he just hoped they were half as good as Kit. Slowly he felt his eyes closing and eventually he succumbed to exhaustion and fell asleep.</p><p>The next day Harry walked into the council chambers. He was wearing his best clothes and his hair was neat. His friends were waiting outside. He bowed to the masters. Then looked at Master Yoda. However it was Mace Windu who spoke. "Harry, we as the Jedi council are incredibly sorry for the loss of your master. Master Fisto was a great man and an incredibly skilled Jedi. It will be hard to find another Jedi as skilled at duelling as he was".</p><p>He didn't know why but Master Windu's words made Harry angry. He looked him straight in the eye and glared at him. "That's all he was to you wasn't it". He spat. "An incredibly skilled Jedi who helped defend the galaxy. Who can be replaced? Well he was more than that to me. He was my master, my mentor, my teacher and most of all he was my friend". He said the last word with venom and walked out of the room. Feeling angrier than he ever had before. Normally he could supress his feelings, but even though he had been trained to let go of emotion. He had always struggled to do it.</p><p>The council sat in stunned silence. Master Windu hated to admit it but that look Harry had given him, had scared him. Then they heard the guard telling them someone wanted to come in. "Enter". Said Yoda.</p><p>The door opened and they saw Harry's three friends enter the room. They walked into the room and bowed. Then Prelo spoke. "Master what was that all about"?</p><p>Mace Windu spoke. "I said something that made him angry. Do you know where he would have gone"?</p><p>Prelo shrugged and so did Yux but Dez spoke. "I do c'mon guys". The other two nodded and they bowed again and left the chambers. When they walked out Aayla looked at Mace Windu.</p><p>"You know master Young Harry did have a point". Master Windu looked stunned but all the other Jedi nodded in agreement.</p><p>Dez, Yux and Prelo walked through the halls of the temple. Eventually Dez lead them to the practice arena and found Harry slaying down dummies with his lightsaber. As they walked to him Dez held out his hand in the universal "wait here" gesture. The others nodded and Dez walked up to his best friends. "Harry mate what happened"?</p><p>Harry looked over his shoulder and saw his friends he deactivated his lightsaber and clipped it to his belt. Then he looked his best friend in the eye. "Master Windu just made me angry. He was saying my master would be hard to replace. Like he was replaceable. He wasn't just my master he was my friend, and I just snapped. And two days after he dies they are giving me a new master not even giving me time to get over it".</p><p>Dez knew what he had to do. He looked at Harry and spoke, "Harry look. As Jedi we are meant to let go of emotion you need to get over it".</p><p>Prelo gasped and anger flashed in Harry's eyes. But Yux smiled he knew what Dez was doing. Harry spoke with definite anger, "so you're saying that I am not even allowed to grieve for my master"?</p><p>Dez shook his head. "No Harry. But we have grieved and it's time to move on, especially you. As the chosen one you can't let your personal feelings stand in the way of your destiny".</p><p>That did it Harry snapped. Hearing what he heard from Master Windu was one thing. But to hear that from his best mate; Harry couldn't believe it". He looked Dez straight in the eye then punched him!</p><p>Dez fell back a bit and smiled, this is the reaction he wanted. He adopted a fighting stance and as Harry went to punch him again Dez blocked it and grabbed him by his wrist. He went to throw Harry onto the ground but Harry countered by kneeing Dez in the stomach which made him let go as a reflex. Harry then threw an almighty punch into his stomach. Dez fell back winded, he had forgotten how strong Harry was.</p><p>Meanwhile Yux and Prelo had seen the whole thing. Prelo went to stop them but Yux stopped him. Prelo looked at him bewildered, "we need to stop them or they will kill each other".</p><p>But Yux shook his head. "This will be good for Harry".</p><p>Prelo looked confused. "What's good about beating up his best friend"?</p><p>Yux smiled slightly. "He isn't beating him up, Dez wants Harry to get his motivation back. You know how competitive those two are. If Harry beats him it will help him break out of his depression". Prelo looked at him for a second. Then understanding came onto his face.</p><p>Prelo saw Harry coming to hit him again but he rolled out the way. He took deep breaths to get air back into his lungs, then as Harry kicked him, he grabbed Harry's leg and pulled it towards him making Harry fall to the ground. Dez then stepped back to recover. However he didn't have much time as Harry was back on his feet, however Dez saw him this time and before Harry had much time to react, Dez punched him round the side of the head and went to follow up with a kick But Harry dodged and span around him and hooked his foot around Dez's led and tripped him up pushing him as he went down.</p><p>Dez rolled around and saw Harry standing over him his fists bunched in a fighting stance. Then his savage expression changed into a smile and he offered Dez a hand up. He grinned and accepted, the fight was over when he pulled him up the two shared a brotherly hug. Dez knew that Harry would be ok.</p><p>Then he spoke, "Mate ready to go back to the Jedi council". Harry nodded and the two friends along with Yux and Prelo left the room.</p><p>Harry entered the Council chambers and before anyone had a chance to speak he looked master Windu straight in the eye. "Master Windu forgive me for my outburst earlier. I wasn't thinking clearly".</p><p>Mace Windu smiled slightly. "Not necessary Harry. I should be the one apologising".</p><p>Then Yoda spoke. "Young Padawan a decision for your new master the council has reached".</p><p>Mace Windu spoke. "Yes we heard about how you two had a good connection so we are proud to announce you're new master will be Obi Wan Kenobi"!</p><p>Harry turned around stunned. Wasn't Obi Wan a Padawan? Then as Obi Wan was walking towards him, Harry noticed he wasn't wearing his hair in a braid which meant that he must have only recently passed the trials, to become a Jedi knight. Harry grinned and shook his hand. It would feel weird having someone who he knew as a Padawan as his master.</p><p>As Harry walked out of the council chambers later that day. He wondered what would happen now with Obi Wan as his master. He could only hope it would go better than when he had Kit as a master.</p><p><em>Eight years later</em></p><p>The last eight years had seen much change in the galactic republic. There had been a new Chancellor elected and so far he had been doing quite a good job. The trade federation had stayed quiet for a few years and since Kit Fisto had been killed. The Sith it appeared had gone back into hiding. However the Jedi Council were still edgy about the possibility of them returning.</p><p>Harry meanwhile had had quite a good eight years. He had gone on many missions with Obi Wan Kenobi and the duo made an admirable team. What either of them lacked the other person made up for it. However ever since he had been his master Obi Wan had noticed something had changed inside Harry. Not the fact that Harry had become more obsessive about fulfilling his destiny, no it was something else.</p><p>It was the fact that Harry now had much less control of his anger. He was more aggressive in lightsaber combat and had lost his temper at Obi Wan numerous times. While Obi Wan doubted Harry would turn to the dark side he was still worried. He had spoken to master Yoda about it and he had agreed to keep a closer eye on Harry as well as Obi Wan. Yoda said that the likely cause for Harry's shorter temper was indeed the loss of his first master. However when he was calm Harry was one of the nicest people Obi Wan had ever met, and there was no doubting he was a skilful Jedi and he was only twenty one. He had even had to save Obi Wan a few times.</p><p>Harry had initially struggled with the loss of his original master but had eventually gotten over it and moved on with his life. He had tried to forget about that first mission to Naboo but there was a part of him that couldn't. Harry knew what it was of course but he couldn't face it, because it would distract him from his duty and his destiny. He spent nearly all of his spare time practicing at whatever Jedi skill there was. Whether it be combat or force or meditating Harry would do it. He still talked to his old friends whenever he saw them but of course as time went on they had slowly grown apart. But they still had deep bonds from their past.</p><p>Harry had buried the connection to his first mission when he was fourteen, to help him focus on being a Jedi and now he was twenty one and it had worked. Or at least he thought it had. That was until the day when he heard he would have to meet Padme Amidala again.</p><p><em>A/N: Holy crap it's been ages since I updated sorry guys, I have had a real busy last few weeks and could only write this in little bits. But I start college soon so the updates are likely to be even slower </em><em> but I promise I will get them out as soon as I can. If you are going to complain about Obi Wan just don't bother ok, I want this to remain to the cannon in some ways. I made it a shorter time between what would be Phantom menace and attack of the clones because Harry is older than Anakin was. Please leave a review.</em></p>
