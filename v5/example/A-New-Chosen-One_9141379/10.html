<h1>10. Chapter 10</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p>Chapter 10</p><p><em>A/N: NO MORE EXAMS GUYS, SO I HAVE NO REVISION SO MORE TIME FOR WRITING :D. I WAS WATCING PM SO I THOUGHT I WOULD WRITE THIS. ON ANOTHER NOTE I AM NOT WRITING ABOUT THE STUFF THE TRADE FEDERATION IS DOING BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING ALL OF THE SAME STUFF THEY DID IN THE</em> <em>FILM. WARNING</em><em>: THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC BELIEFS IN THIS CHAPTER THAT GO AGAINST RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY SUCH MATERIAL THAT WAS NOT MY INTENT.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: I do not own star wars or Harry Potter I only own a few characters.</em></p><p>Harry walked through the ship's corridors and collapsed down on a seat. His stomach was full of hot thick guilt. They had left Naboo and its citizens to fight for themselves against the Trade Federation. Who would no doubt starve the innocent people to death, kill any people who tried to fight against them, destroy all of the natural resources and all in all destroy the planet. In the overall sighting of events it looked like the old king had gotten exactly what he wanted.</p><p>He hid his face in his hand's trying not to think about Captain Panaka and the guards who had doubtless given up their lives to let them get out of the Palace. The Jedi were meant to use the force for peace but all they had really done in leaving is make the situation on the planet much worse.</p><p>Harry heard someone sit next to him and he looked up into the concerned face of his friend. Yux didn't say anything but just looked at him. He knew Harry was feeling guilty about leaving Naboo and its citizens to fend for themselves. Of course Yux felt guilty too but unlike Harry it had not been his home for the last couple of months.</p><p>After a while Yux did speak "Harry I know how you are feeling but we will do something. The senate doesn't believe in the invasion but you must have noticed the Queen. She will fight for her people even I can see that".</p><p>Harry smiled slightly. Even though Yux was talking about the decoy Queen Harry knew Padme would fight for her people. He looked at Yux and smiled. "Yeah mate your right".</p><p>Yux grinned and the two bumped fists, "there's the Harry I know, now c'mon the Queen wants to see us".</p><p>Harry nodded and the two went to the Queen's chamber on the ship. Harry knew that Padme had been reluctant to leave but leaving Naboo meant she could plan an attack better than if she stayed on Naboo.</p><p>The two young Jedi sat in the large room on the ship listening to the debate going on. Harry was so bored he was having a job keeping his eyes open and eventually he lost the battle and he fall asleep.</p><p>Harry woke up to a sharp smack on his shoulder. He looked up and saw Yux standing over him. He shook his head, "man Harry if it wasn't for me you would be in deep shit now, I was using the force to keep your head up to make it look like you were awake. You owe me big time. Any way we need to get strapped in, the ship is landing now".</p><p>Eventually the ship landed and Harry and Yux took a speeder directly to the Jedi temple. Harry went straight to his room and dropped his stuff in a corner. Then he walked straight into his bathroom and took a long shower. Letting the scalding hot water sooth him.</p><p>Eventually he stepped out and pulled on a jet black pair of trousers and lay back on his bed. Then he heard his buzzer go and he let the door open and he saw Dez walk in. The two friends grinned at each other and they slapped each other on the back. Then Dez spoke, "so how did the mission go"?</p><p>Harry smiled, "well you know I can't give you details but for a long time it looked like we were going to fail but at the end I think we did ok. My Master hasn't talked to the council yet so I don't know how they think it went".</p><p>Dez nodded. He would never tell Harry but he was seething with jealousy. He knew Harry was the Chosen One and because of that Harry had got a big mission right after they became Padawan's. He knew it seemed childish and pathetic but even though Harry and Dez and their friends were Jedi. They were only thirteen or fourteen. So even though they had to grow up faster than anyone else, they still sometimes slipped back into this more childish state.</p><p>After a while Yux and Prelo came in as well. They all sat around and joked together just like they had when they were in a clan. Harry however didn't feel much like joking around. He knew that unless the almost impossibility came along that he would have to go back to Naboo, he would never see Padme again. Not as they both wanted to anyway. He had known all along that this would happen but all the same he still felt devastated.</p><p>All of his friends also noticed his behaviour. They knew this was not like Harry. Harry was normally the leader of their group, the main joker or the talker. They didn't know what was causing Harry to withdraw himself, but could only link it to the mission, as he had been fine before he left.</p><p>Eventually Kit came to Harry's room. "Harry c'mon the council want to talk with you". Harry nodded and quickly put on his tunic and laced up his boots. The master and the apprentice walked to the council chambers not talking, Kit like his friends had noticed Harry excluding himself. And that was before they got back to Coruscant. He knew asking Harry about it wasn't the right move so he just decided to see if anything changed at certain times.</p><p>Eventually the two made it to the council chamber and were called in almost instantly. They walked in and bowed. Harry got anxious when he noticed it was a full council apart from his master. Mace Windu looked at Harry and said, "Young Padawan we heard good things about you from Kit Fisto. Apparently you saved the Queen's life but didn't let it go to your head".</p><p>Harry smiled slightly and nodded to show it was true. Then master Yoda spoke, "sense something else I do". Harry panicked; if Master Yoda worked out that he was in love and had not let it go he could face expulsion from the order.</p><p>Then Ki Adi Mundi spoke. "Padawan your thoughts dwell on the mission or something about Naboo".</p><p>Harry quickly thought up an excuse, "Well um, because I had never been to another planet before now, and because Naboo was so different it just got me thinking about my home planet. It does not show up in the archives and so I hardly know anything about it".</p><p>Mace Windu looked at him curiously. "If we show you your home planet will you stop thinking like this"?</p><p>Harry nodded "Yes master".</p><p>Yoda nodded "very well Kit Fisto show him you will".</p><p>Kit Fisto nodded and the two bowed and left. Then Mace Windu looked at Yoda "I sense something else other than his home planet". Yoda didn't reply but simply looked deep in thought.</p><p><strong>(Warning scientific beliefs start here if you are offended by such material look away now)</strong></p><p>Meanwhile in the archive's Harry sat at a screen with his master. "Ok Harry the reason you were hardly told anything about your home planet other than its name and race was because we didn't want you to become emotionally attached".</p><p>Harry nodded to show he understood. Kit picked out a file. Then loaded it in to the screen. Then all of a sudden a galaxy showed up on the screen. "Harry this galaxy is called the Milky Way and the range of planets are called the solar system. The planet you come from is right there". He pointed to a screen to show Earth and it zoomed in on it. It then showed information about the planet such as race, animals, history and advances made in technology.</p><p>Harry started reading. "Ok so the galaxy was created along with the rest of the universe by a huge explosion known as the big bang. Then millions of years later Earth was formed". Harry spent the rest of the afternoon reading about his home planet and some of the details fascinated him. Such as the way humans had developed from primate like creatures into what they were now. He also was fascinated by the debate between science and religion. The celebrations they had on different parts of the world, he was also taken in by the stories that young children heard, such as magic or kid spies.</p><p>When it was getting to early evening he felt a tap on his shoulder he turned to see his master. "Harry we have to leave the Queen wants to go back to her home planet we have been assigned to protect her". Harry nodded and sprinted to his room to grab his utility belt then ran to the pad where the ship landed.</p><p>When he got there he saw Obi Wan Kenobi and his master standing there along with his master. When Obi Wan saw him he smiled "Good to see you Harry I have heard good things about you". Harry smiled and accepted the compliment. Then Kit stepped up to Qui Gon Ginn. "Ready to go"? Qui Gon just nodded and together along with Jar-Jar Binks who was excited to go home and the Queen and her hand maidens they stepped onto the ship to try and end this madness once and for all.</p><p><em>A/N: Hope it was good, next chapter invasion and big battle. Someone will die but who? And guys you may have to wait a while for the next chapter because my passion for writing sucks right now I don't have any. Again with the scientific beliefs I hope I didn't offend any religious readers. Until Next time FF11</em></p>
