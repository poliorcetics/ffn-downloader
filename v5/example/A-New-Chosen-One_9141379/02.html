<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p>Chapter 2</p><p><em>A/N: I'm gonna start with Harry becoming an apprentice as that's what people asked for if you wanted an upbringing you should reviewed and said so</em></p><p><em>I own nothing except the plot and a few of the characters are my own creations like Dez.</em></p><p><em>My first story to be put into a community I love you guys</em></p><p><em>For the purpose of the story Harry is older than Anakin was and this is a year before the events of the Phantom Menace.</em></p><p><em>Harry is twelve by this point nearly thirteen</em></p><p>Harry Potter opened his eyes in the Jedi temple on Coruscant. It was the same way he could remember waking up as long as he could remember ever since he was a baby.</p><p>Every day at the temple except one at the end of a week was the same. Wake up early, shower, dress, get some breakfast before doing an hour of meditation that was followed by lessons. The lessons were lightsaber combat with Yoda, force studies and politics. Harry then had a midday meal followed by meditation, then exercise for an hour then another hour's meditation.</p><p>After this the youngling clans had a chance to relax in the temple. They cleared their minds of the force and they enjoyed a chance to act like kids for a while, messing around, joking with each other and trying to use the force on each other.</p><p>The clans the younglings and initiates lived in acted like family and helped each other in everything. They also had to memorize the Jedi code and know the layout of the temple of by heart. They were also expected to do two sessions of meditation everyday after lessons finished.</p><p>However, today was different for Harry as he remembered what he had to do and his stomach lurched with nerves. But he knew he needed to have control of his emotions and took some deep breaths to calm himself down.</p><p>He stepped into a bathroom and showered slowly the hot water calming him and helping him focus. As he dried off and looked at his messy black hair, he sighed slowly, with any luck he would be braiding it today. Today was the day he had his trials to become a Padawan.</p><p>He dressed in his Dark grey tunic and grey trousers. He buckled his belt to his waist and clipped his old lightsaber to it before walking out of his room and looked towards the doors leading to the rooms of his clan mates. There were five other boys and four girls with him in the clan and their rooms opened into a shared chamber. They had been like brothers and sisters to him since they were about three. He turned and looked at his best friend Dez, Harry along with Dez and one more boy and a girl were the only humans in the clan.</p><p>Harry looked at him and smiled, the boys had connected instantly during the first few days of being in their new clan. Dez had been using force accidently, causing him to break things and, after he had got told off, Harry had comforted him. From then on the two had been inseparable. They meditated together, ate together, played sports together and practiced Jedi skills together from combat to learning the code.</p><p>Today they would be separated because Dez was six months younger than Harry; Dez had turned twelve five months ago and still had a little more to learn because of his occasional arrogance and anger. Harry sighed it was going to be tough being separated but they had known it was coming and had been waiting for it for a while, so he hoped he would be okay.</p><p>Harry took one last look at his friends and walked out of the chambers he shared with them.</p><p>Harry walked through the corridors of the Jedi Temple bowing to the Jedi Masters he saw and nodding to the padawans and the knights. He looked out several windows and saw the city was waking up. Several transports and ships were flying around the city and several buildings were lighting up the darkness of the city. Harry sighed as he looked at the inky black sky and the stars scattered across it. Hopefully he would be flying amongst them soon.</p><p>He broke out of his deep thought and walked to a room at the end of a corridor three floors up from the Jedi youngling quarters. He walked to a big circular door and punched in a code and the door rolled across to admit him.</p><p>Harry walked into a small room with round chairs and no windows and the lights were off.</p><p>He moved to sit in the round chair that was positioned in dead centre of the room and crossed his legs. He put his arms stiff by his sides and took a deep breath. He closed his eyes and breathed out. He felt his body relax, and let the force flow through his body. His breathing was even and he zoned out from the rest of the world.</p><p>He felt in tune with the force and felt its power course around and through his body. However he concentrated the power on the knowledge he had learnt in nearly twelve years at the temple. His knowledge increased slightly as he felt everything he had learnt flow through his brain. Memories came forward and he remembered every major event in his life. He focused the power completely on his meditation now and felt himself distance even further from the Galaxy.</p><p>His mind seemed to course through pure tubes of power and he felt more force than he had ever felt before. His physical body felt like it no longer existed and felt his spirit rise. He could feel his force level increase and then the power exploded and he zoomed out of this state of mind and could now feel his surroundings by using his force powers as his body came back to him. This was something he had been able to do but it had never been this easy. He had never felt this close to the living force or this power before. He felt like a filter had been removed from his powers and let all the energy through. He felt <em>alive! </em>He took a few deep breaths to calm himself and slowly and carefully opened his eyes.</p><p>He felt energized and peaceful, his head was clear and his body was relaxed. He finally understood why the Jedi meditated, if it worked properly it would really help out on a mission or just to train. He stood up slowly stretched and walked out of the room and onto a balcony in the corridor outside.</p><p>The sun was coming out and had created a smudge in the inky black sky. There was a faint breeze that brushed against his face and again there was the faint sound of ships and transports but slightly louder than earlier.</p><p>He stood on the balcony for a few minutes his eyes closed and letting the force take in his surroundings. He admired the pure beauty of the planet and felt his body relax even further than it had during meditation. He took deep breaths and let the force surround his mind.</p><p>After a few minutes he walked back inside and walked to another level of the Jedi temple, which he could tell was waking up. More people were walking around now but it was mostly masters and council members, there were a few Jedi Knights around though. Unlike earlier however, he could not see any Padawans and guessed that they were training.</p><p>As he moved towards the room he was looking for, he passed the Jedi Archives that he had spent many years learning the outline of the Galaxy, the Jedi's history and the code among other things. Finally he reached the youngling training room and, as he expected, it was empty. He pulled a blaster orb out, covered his eyes with a helmet and got his lightsaber out.</p><p>After half an hour of blocking blaster shots he programed some dummies to come out so he could practice on them. Harry was an agile warrior he favoured fast style and the Soresu form with his agility added in. It was not one of the more aggressive styles but it was extremely effective. Also due to the fact that Yoda taught them the basics of most combat styles he could mix them up in the combat to make it more effective against enemies with lightsabers.</p><p>Another half an hour later Harry was exhausted but felt energized and awake. He quickly had another shower and dashed through the now fully awake Jedi temple, to have some breakfast before his trials began.</p><p>As he entered the canteen he saw his friends Dez, Yux Opla and Prelo Kolp standing in the queue waiting for breakfast, when they saw him they called him over. When he joined them Dez bumped fists with him saying, "There you are Harry! When we woke up, you were gone and we couldn't find you, we knew what today was but we thought you would have liked some sleep." The other two nodded and Harry bumped fists with them too with a small smile on his face at Dez's ribbing.</p><p>After they had gotten their food, they joined a table with other kids their age from other clans. As they ate it was the usual banter of nicking each other's food and insulting the masters.</p><p>After they had finished Master Yoda and Mace Windu came to the front. Immediately silence fell upon the younglings and they all stared at the front.</p><p>The two Jedi masters stared at the sea of little heads and Mace Windu spoke, "Younglings, as you know a number of you are undertaking trials to become padawan's today, because of that all of you have the day off to do what you please, you can remain in your quarters, you can train, you can play sport or whatever just please don't disturb the Jedi at the temple."</p><p>The rest of the younglings chorused, "Yes, Master Windu." All of their voices exactly in tune with each other.</p><p>Then Yoda came forward and spoke, "If undertaking trials you are, to the biggest classroom go and instructions given out they will be." With that the two masters walked out (or in Yoda's case he floated on his floating chair).</p><p>The younglings took this as their cue to leave and they all scrambled out of the canteen, excited about their day off. Harry was walking with his friends to the biggest classroom in the temple as they were laughing and joking together; Harry was letting the force flow through him once again and was trying to remember anything he had ever learnt. Then, sooner than they thought possible, they reached the door to the biggest classroom.</p><p>Harry turned to look at his friends they were all looking at him with sad smiles on their faces. Six people from their clan were dong the trials today, however, due to their age, his three friends and another boy from the clan were not allowed to do their trials today. They would have to wait a few months before they were given the chance.</p><p>Dez reached forward and put a hand on Harry's shoulder, "Mate as much as I want to come in there with you, I can't. Good luck mate and remember to come back to the quarters after everyone else is finished."</p><p>Harry nodded, "Thanks guys see you later." They all nodded to him and Harry turned around, took a deep breath and entered the classroom. Harry looked around the room for a moment before seeing a few of the other members of his clan who all smiled at him, he moved over to sit next to one of his clan members, receiving a thumbs up sign from one which he returned along with a smile.</p><p>Master Windu walked to the front of the class, "Ok younglings, you know what today is. Today is your chance to become Jedi padawans which is the next step into the world of the Jedi and, with a master, you could help defend the galaxy, however you only have one shot at today if you fail, you don't get another chance and the council will give you three other choices, do you understand?"</p><p>They all chorused back, "Yes Master Windu."</p><p>The Jedi Master nodded, "Good, now I need to go into the testing room to judge you with Master Yoda. I have three Jedi here to look after you here." Then he shouted to the closed door behind them, "You can come in now."</p><p>The door opened and three Jedi walked in; one looked like a padawan, the other two were either Knights or Masters. As the three Jedi moved to stand next to him, Master Windu spoke again, "Younglings please say hello to Jedi padawan Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi knights Sate Crux and Petrak."</p><p>They all chorused again, "Hello Jedi sir." –that's what they were meant to say when talking to Jedi of different ranks.</p><p>The three Jedi nodded back, "Hello".</p><p>Mace Windu spoke up once more, "Ok younglings, you will be called out one by one to undertake the trials. The first one is Urro Azkadine, good luck."</p><p>A thin boy who looked like he was of Nikto species stood up and walked through a side door with the Jedi master and silence came over the group for a minute before they all started talking about how nervous they were or how excited they were.</p><p>Well, almost all of them, Harry sat in a corner away from the larger group of initiates and began meditating. He sat on a chair his legs crossed doing exactly as he had done before in the meditation room and all the Jedi at the front saw him.</p><p>Kenobi whispered to the other two Jedi's who were to be watching the initiates, "We should make them all do that, you know? I remember how stressed I was on the day of my trials."</p><p>The other Jedi nodded, "C'mon."</p><p>Sate Crux went to the front and shouted, "Ok younglings, we can see your excited but if you look at the back a young man there is meditating, and we remember being in your shoes and how stressed we were so we think it would help so c'mon, grab a chair and start."</p><p>The younglings groaned slightly but did as they were told because they had to show respect. They sat at a desk and started meditating.</p><p>As the Jedi watched, they saw Harry go through the same experience as he had earlier that day, and having gone through it themselves they knew what had happened and could tell from the way his face and body were so relaxed.</p><p>Kenobi looked at the others, a concerned look on his face "Could you guys meditate the way a Jedi is meant to as a youngling because I sure couldn't."</p><p>The other Jedi looked at him as if he was mad, "Of course we couldn't, I doubt even Master Yoda could. We need to talk to him about this because as he is so young, the power could get the better of him." Said Petrak</p><p>The others nodded, "Yeah I agree." said Sate Crux, "I don't even know <em>how</em> he is doing it though, I haven't ever heard of someone having enough power to do it as a youngling."</p><p>The others said no more but just watched the rest of the younglings meditate and, as their names were called, they got up and left.</p><p>Finally Harry's name was called and then the other Jedi understood; he could meditate the way Jedi were meant to because he was meant to be the chosen one.</p><p>Harry walked down the corridor with Master Windu. He was calming himself with his knowledge and trying to remember his lightsaber combat style.</p><p>When they reached the room they were going to, Harry realized it was a room he had never seen open and now he knew why. As the door opened and they walked in Harry saw a round room with a desk, some dummies and a large round object at one end that he had no idea what it was.</p><p>Windu showed Harry to the desk and told him to sit before walking away from the desk. Harry looked around again and saw a long table on a stand above him. At the table were Masters Yoda, Ki Adi Mundi, Kit Fisto, Qui-Gon Gin and Mace Windu (who had just sat down).</p><p>Then Ki Adi Mundi stood up, "Harry Potter, youngling, twelve years of age here for his padawan trials." He said clearly and loudly before he turned his gaze to look at Harry, "Harry, you see the screen in front of you? It will come up with questions on everything you have learnt in your twelve years at the temple, complete as many questions as you can. You have ninety minutes starting now."</p><p>Harry pulled the screen and the computer towards him and started to answer the questions. He was surprised at how easy he found them considering some of the stuff he had learnt ten years ago. When he was out of time he had done over three hundred questions and thought he caught looks of surprise on the masters' faces.</p><p>After the first test, he had to show his ability with a lightsaber and even though the blade was losing power slowly, he did well. He slayed over one hundred dummies and thanks to his agility he only got hit five times with the practice sabers.</p><p>Then he turned his attention to the huge ball at the back off the room, it opened and a machine blaster cannon was poking out if it. He quickly understood what he had to do, he had to prevent the shot hitting him in any way possible.</p><p>He heard the countdown from Ki, "Harry don't worry its low powered, three, two, one, go!"</p><p>The blasters began firing right away. Harry moved his lightsaber, deflecting some leaping backwards to gain a little more space, blocking shots as he went. He landed and started pulling things from the ground with the force to defend himself. He used his lightsaber to block more shots but then realized there was something else he could try; it was something no youngling should be able to do due to their lack of power. But he thought about the fact that being a Jedi was not risk free so it was worth a shot.</p><p>He put his lightsaber away jumped for cover and took some deep breaths, before he began to summon all the force he could. When he felt the same amount of power he felt that morning, he leapt from behind his cover and waited.</p><p>The shots came at him and Harry raised his hands and used force push. The shots that were heading to him stopped slowly and started heading backwards and collided with the cannon causing enough damage that it suddenly exploded!</p><p>The masters looked at Harry shock evident on their faces. Harry looked at them with a sheepish look on his face. After a few moments, Qui-Gon managed to speak, "Thanks…um, Harry please return to your quarters and we will speak to you later."</p><p>Harry made his way back to his clan's chambers unsurely. He walked into the quarters to see the rest of the clan sitting there (the others had gone before him). Dez looked at him stood up and bumped fists with him, "Hey mate how did it go?"</p><p>They both sat down next to Yux and Prelo, "It went ok, I guess, but they looked pretty shocked at the end so I don't know it that's a good or bad thing." They all nodded to show they understood.</p><p>Then Yux spoke, "Hey guys lets go get an early dinner I am starving."</p><p>The other three boys laughed as Prelo said, "Yux I swear to the Order you are always thinking of your stomach."</p><p>Yux glared, "Shut up, its normal, my species need to eat a lot."</p><p>The other boys had to admit that. They had researched all major species within the galaxy over the years and one of the key features of Yux's species that it had an enormous stomach. Dez spoke up after a moment, "Well come on then, it will help pass time." Together the boys left for the canteen for dinner.</p><p>Two hours later the boys got back from dinner. Dez collapsed down on the couch and groaned. "One of these days do you reckon I will get that just because it's an 'all you can eat' buffet, it does not mean that you <em>have</em> to eat all of it?"</p><p>The other boys laughed at his discomfort. Then Yux said, "You wimp, I ate at least four times the amount you did."</p><p>Dez looked at him, "Yeah, well your species stomachs are at least four times bigger than a humans so we ate about the same if you think about it. I filled my stomach and so did your."</p><p>By this point, Prelo was laughing so hard his face was turning from red to blue (Prelo is the same species as Shaak Ti) and the other two were not much better. Dez looked around after a moment and noticed that Harry was talking to one of the caretakers who looked after the younglings and pointed this out to the other two.</p><p>When the caretaker left the others ran to Harry, "So?" Asked Dez.</p><p>Harry grinned, "The Council wants to see me."</p><p>The rest of the guys smiled too, they knew this meant that it was probably good news. They all slapped him on the back, "Good luck mate." They all said. Harry nodded and sprinted out of the room.</p><p>The guard walked Harry in front of the council and Harry saw Master Yoda and Mace Windu who, today being a rare exception, the younglings hardly ever saw outside of the classroom.</p><p>"Young Potter, good today you were." Said Yoda.</p><p>Mace Windu smiled, "That's putting it lightly, Harry you got the second highest score ever recorded at the trials for younglings, behind Yoda."</p><p>Harry was beyond shocked; he had more power than Master Windu had at his age!</p><p>The others smiled, "We knew that would shock you." Said a voice behind him and he realized it was the padawan he had seen earlier sitting beside Qui-Gon Gin who had to be his master. Harry grinned at him.</p><p>"Yes, so Harry, needless to say you passed." said Ki Adi Mundi.</p><p>Harry felt like his heart would burst with happiness; he had done it he was a padawan!</p><p>"Yes, passed you did," said Yoda.</p><p>Mace Windu then spoke up, "Now as you know Harry, a padawan has a master who they follow and learn from. The council is pleased to announce that your new master is Kit Fisto!"</p><p>Harry turned around to see a Nautolan Jedi come towards him and smiled. Harry had met Fisto a few times and had got on with him very well. The two shook hands and Kit said, "Harry, I am honoured to be your master, I am sure we will work well together and I am also certain you will make a great Jedi."</p><p>Harry swelled at the praise, "Thank you, Master." Kit gave his trademark grin.</p><p>"That attitude will get you far Harry, now I believe as a padawan you get your own quarters so I suggest you go and say goodbye to your clan, we will talk more in the morning."</p><p>Harry nodded and as he did it, despite the happiness of becoming a Padawan, he would now have to say goodbye to the people who were his family in all but blood.</p><p>He said a quick goodbye and thanked the masters and sprinted to the quarters. He quickly punched in the code and sprinted to his best mates.</p><p>They looked at him and smiled. Dez said, "I take it by your grin that you passed."</p><p>Harry nodded eagerly, "Yup my new master is Kit Fisto."</p><p>The others smiled before Yux stated, "Lucky he is such a laugh."</p><p>Then they all got sad looks, "So now I guess you have to leave." Said Dez and Harry nodded sadly.</p><p>Harry took a breath before saying, "C'mon I will pack and we can walk to my new quarters and say goodbye there." The others nodded and walked to the room they slept in with the other boys from the clan.</p><p>Harry pulled a small bag from under his bed and packed the few things he owned: a toothbrush, two spare tunics, spare trousers, and extra cloak, a spare belt and a photo of the whole clan standing together when they were about seven or eight.</p><p>Then as he was walking out he remembered something. He dashed back to the bedside table and opened the draw. Inside was a necklace it was a plain leather brown strap with a triangle, a circle inside it and a line up the middle. Apparently he had been wearing it when he came from his own universe and he had made it fit him as each year went by, he had worn it every day up until about a year ago when he got the feeling he would not have it after he took it with him. As it was the only link to his own universe he did not want to lose it so he kept it safe in the draw.</p><p>He walked out and his friends and they looked at him, "Ready?" asked Dez. Harry nodded and they walked out.</p><p>Harry stood outside the door to his new quarters facing his friends. For the first time there walk through the temple had not been fun it had been near silence. It was dark now but the moonlight reflected the sadness in his friends' faces.</p><p>Harry took a breath to calm his nerves and spoke, "Guys we have been friends for as long as we can all remember and remember this is not goodbye just because I am leaving, we all knew we were going to go our separate ways one day but remember we will still see each other and you will be going into these rooms soon any republic credits you like."</p><p>They all looked at Harry and one by one they hugged him, "Yeah Harry's right," said Dez, "We will still see each other." They all nodded to each other and one hug later the three boys walked off and Harry entered his room, and knew this was another step on his Jedi Journey.</p><p>A/N:<em> hope this was good longest chapter ever written twelve pages hope u like it. Dez will be coming back and the other two may make a cameo. Obi Wan will also appear more and Padme will be in it soon. Kit Fisto is one of my fave characters and as Obi Wan was too young to be his master Kit was my next choice. If any of you are wondering if Anakin will make an appearance I have not decided yet but if he does it will only be here and there and will obvs not turn to the dark side. As some of you may hove figured out the neclace is the DH symbol u will see its use in a chapter or two as always please review i like to hear people like my stuff</em></p>
