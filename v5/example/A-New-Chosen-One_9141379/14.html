<h1>14. Chapter 14</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p><em>A/N: hey guys can I just say college is awesome! Anyways here's the next one hope you enjoy it. I am just going to say THIS IS NOT STARWARS WITH ANAKIN BEING CALLED HARRY. I WILL BE MAKING IT MORE OF A CROSSOVER FIC IN LATER CHAPTERS AND JUST BE PATIENT I HAVE A PLAN AND I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.</em></p><p>Harry Potter walked through the halls of the Jedi temple on Coruscant. The masters and the knights bowed to him respectfully. Harry smiled. He was twenty one years old, he was just over six feet tall and was lean with muscle. His hair was still as unruly as ever and due to him being Padawan still short. But it was still jet black and he now had a longer, thin braid come down to between his shoulder blades. He also had a large scar on his face and his skin had a leathery tan.</p><p>Harry was now one of the most respected Jedi in the temple. He might not be as good with the force as other, more experienced Jedi. He may not also be as agile as others. But he was defiantly one of the bravest. His brave feats on missions had earned him the respect of many of his fellow Jedi knights and masters alike. He and his master Obi-Wan had fought in countless battles and they were a very effective and efficient team. They were both very skilful Jedi, were talented in combat and, (mostly in Obi Wan's case) good at negotiating. Harry still talked to his childhood friends; Dez, Yux and Prelo. Of course they were not as close as they had been. But they still had a deep bond from there past. Dez had also become quite Jealous of Harry over the last couple of years. He tried to hide it but Harry saw it. The reason for it was because Harry had been on more missions than him, and was more respected. He was also curious as to why Harry got compliments and had a friendship with Chancellor Palpatine.</p><p>Obi Wan owed Harry his life several times over, but to Harry it didn't matter. He felt it as just doing his duty and he knew Obi Wan would do the same for him. The two together had definitely stopped wars with several species all over the galaxy. Harry thought that the two of them were surely becoming one of the greatest master and apprentice duos of all time.</p><p>However despite all these feats Harry still felt the council were holding him back. Mostly this was because he was still a Padawan when he thought that he had earned the right to become a Jedi knight. However the Council still said he was not ready. Harry knew deep down this was due to his short temper and anger and even occasional arrogance. The three main things that led to the dark side of the force.</p><p>Harry was walking towards the council chambers. He had a hope that today was the day the council would say that he had earned the right to become a Jedi Knight. However he had learnt the hard way before, not to get his hopes up.</p><p>As he reached the Council Chambers he saw his master Obi Wan was already there. He nodded to him and smiled. He had a great respect for Obi Wan and looked up to him like a father. He had taught Harry a lot of things and he had benefited greatly. Whether it was lightsaber combat or force training or just general learning, Harry had developed a lot of respect for him. Maybe even more so than Kit Fisto, his original master who had tragically died, on his first mission.</p><p>Eventually the door opened and the Master and the Apprentice stepped in. They bowed to the masters and Harry took a quick moment to look around. Even though it had been nearly a decade the Council had not changed much. Master Yoda was still there of course as was Mace Windu. Qui Gon Jinn had eventually made it onto the council as a proper master, rather than on a temporary basis like before. Aayla Secura sat in her chair like she had eight years ago and Shaak Ti was another new addition.</p><p>As the two Jedi stood up Master Yoda spoke. "Master Obi Wan, Padawan Potter a new mission we have for you".</p><p>Harry couldn't help but smile slightly. He liked it when he was sent on missions. It meant the council trusted him and his master to carry out the duty of the Jedi. It also gave him another chance to become a Jedi Knight.</p><p>Then Obi Wan spoke. "Very well master what is this mission".</p><p>Master Windu spoke, "Protect the senator Amidala, she was almost killed in an explosion today. We suspect it may have been the separatists. This mission is a request by the Chancellor. She is here to discuss the military creation act".</p><p>Harry's head snapped up and his eyes went wide. His heart sped up and he felt his knees go weak. Surely he had heard wrong, but he knew that he hadn't. There was no mistaking that name. Amidala. Or Padme as she always had been to Harry. They had met many years ago on his first mission during the trade federation's invasion of Naboo, her home planet. The two had developed feelings for each other and had acted on them. In doing so Harry had broken one of the most sacred laws of the Jedi code. She had been the Queen of Naboo for a few years but was now a senator for Naboo. Harry hadn't seen her since Kit Fisto's funeral. They had, had a conversation on the morning of the day and had agreed to end the brief relationship they had. However despite this Harry had never forgotten her. He had tried but couldn't, so he had buried his feelings for her to focus on becoming a Jedi. He had thought he was over her but he had always known he wasn't. He looked at his master silently praying he would reject the mission, but he knew he wouldn't.</p><p>Obi Wan nodded, "Of course master do we go to her apartment on the other side of the city and just lookout for suspicious activity".</p><p>Qui Gon nodded with a slight chuckle. "Yes Obi Wan may the force be with you my old apprentice".</p><p>Obi Wan grinned and he and Harry bowed to the masters. Harrys stomach in knots and his mind a whirl with worry. However as him and his master, took a speeder to the other side of the city to the senators apartment, he could not hide the anticipation.</p><p>Padme Amidala sat on a chair in her Coruscant apartment. The attempt on her life today had scared her, but it was hardly the first time she had, had an attempt on her life. However since she had become a senator it was the first one she had had for a long time. As a Queen she had, had a few and even one before she had become monarch. But she never thought about that.</p><p>She had, had a successful term as Queen. She had restored Naboo, after the invasion of the trade federation. She didn't agree with the military creation act, because she came from a peaceful planet and believed that the separatist movement could be stopped peacefully. She did not want the republic to dissolve into a war. However after the attempt on her life she had heard that she had, had even more security in the form of two Jedi. It was the first time she had worked with Jedi for nearly a decade. However like the attempt on her life before she was Queen, she never thought about it.</p><p>"Senator Amidala"?</p><p>Padme looked up to see junior representative of Naboo Jar-Jar Binks. She smiled at him. The Gungan was the first of his type to represent Naboo. She nodded to him to say he could speak.</p><p>"Theysa Jedi will be here soon".</p><p>Padme nodded. "Yes representative Binks. Do you know who the Jedi will be"?</p><p>The Gungan Nodded. "Theysa be Jedi Knight Obi Wan Kenobi and Padawan Harry Potter mesa heard".</p><p>However Padme didn't hear the last two words. She felt her blood turn to ice and her heart sped up to a speed she didn't think was possible. She had smiled when she had heard that Obi Wan would help protect her. She had met him briefly on Naboo and he had helped recover Naboo from the trade federation, by killing an evil fighter who was rumoured to have been a Sith lord but of course the Jedi never confirmed it. But Obi Wan was loyal a good duellist and she had a great deal of respect for him.</p><p>However her smile had vanished when she had heard the name Harry Potter. She had met him shortly before the trade federation's invasion of Naboo. They were both thirteen and Padme had developed feelings for the young Jedi and he had returned the action. They had both acted on them and in doing so Harry had disobeyed his Jedi vows. He had also saved her life and had lost his master Kit Fisto on that mission. He was the reason she never thought about anything in the year before she became Queen. Because she knew that she would end up thinking of Harry. She had never gotten over him and had never even tried. She had just buried her feelings for him and had stopped thinking about him. On the morning of his last day on Naboo they had agreed to part ways. But as she was walking away from him, she had heard him mutter that he would always love her. She didn't know if he knew she had heard him, but because she had, walking away from him after he said that had been the single hardest thing she had ever done.</p><p>She was broken out of her thoughts, by her hand-maidens arriving. She stood up quickly, wiped her eyes of the tears that had been threatening. That had been the first time she had thought about Harry on over five years. But then again in a way she had always thought of him, as she had always remembered him.</p><p>Harry and Obi Wan were in an elevator, going up to Padme's top floor apartment. Harry was feeling incredibly nervous, and his master noticed. He was curious as to why. They had been on far more dangerous missions than this, he decided to keep an eye on Harry to see if he could work out why he was nervous.</p><p>Eventually the elevator reached the top floor and the doors opened. Harry's heart jumped to his throat. However he did smile when the Gungan Jar-Jar Binks greeted them. Like Padme he had met the Gungan on his first mission, they got on really well. He took them to the main room in Padme's apartment, and Harry's heart felt like it was going at light speed. He stood behind Obi-Wan but he was taller. As they reached the room Harry saw some guards and then his eyes fell upon her. Padme Amidala. The years hadn't changed her looks much. She still had the soft brown hair, light soft skin, brown eyes a slim build. Harry looked into her eyes and felt happiness he had not felt in years. He could still get lost in her eyes. Then his conscious cut across his thoughts. <em>This is wrong, I can't like her this way it will only lead to trouble for the two of us. </em></p><p>Padme looked up as Jar-Jar Binks lead the two Jedi too her. She saw Obi Wan first. He had changed much since he was a Padawan. He now had longer hair and a beard. Then she looked behind him and saw the man she had loved as a teenager. Harry Potter. He had changed a lot. Well it was to be expected of course. He was much taller than her now, his hair had a much longer braid and his lean body was clearly showing muscle. His face had a large scar down it, how he had gotten it she didn't want to think about. Then she looked into his eyes and then remembered; his bright piercing green eyes. She had loved them so much, then she remembered when they went dull, and grey after he lost his master. She was thrilled to see him again and wanted nothing more than to fling herself into his arms, his strong arms. But she knew she couldn't, and then she felt that familiar feeling of dread she had felt when they had started dating.</p><p>She took a deep breath and stood up. She walked over to the two Jedi and looked at Obi Wan. "Master Obi Wan it is a pleasure to see you again".</p><p>Obi Wan smiled and bowed to the young senator. "Senator it is an honour to see you again, I just wish it were in better circumstances".</p><p>Padme smiled and nodded, she wished it was too. Then she knew what she had to do. She looked over Obi Wan's shoulder, looked at Harry and spoke. "Harry, I never thought I would see you again but I am glad I have. I have heard many good things about you".</p><p>Harry smiled and looked at Padme. "Padme I have heard good things about you too. I am also glad we have seen each other again".</p><p>Meanwhile Obi Wan was looking on curious. He never knew Harry and the senator knew each other. Let alone were on first name terms. He decided to keep an eye on the two. Then he noticed Harry's expression. He hadn't known him very well before Kit Fisto died. But Harry's face was showing happiness he had never seen as his master. He wasn't smiling but his eyes were bright and he was very relaxed. He didn't know if it was the presence of Senator Amidala or something else but it was very strange. He decided he needed to have a word with Master Windu and Yoda when he next had the chance.</p><p>The Jedi and the senator sat on a sofa in the middle of the apartment. Harry didn't say much but just looked at the ground or at Padme when she spoke. Padme desperately wanted to know who way trying to kill her. She didn't want more security she wanted awnsers. Obi Wan was adamant that they were just here to do what the council sent them to do. Eventually Padme excused herself and retired to her bedroom.</p><p>As soon as they were the only two people in the room, Obi Wan looked at Harry and asked, "How do you know the senator well enough to be on first name terms"?</p><p>Harry was staring out of the big window at the front of the apartment and didn't even look round as he answered. "My first mission, I was meditating down by the lake and she saw me. We were both only teenagers. We got talking and became friends. Today when she called me by my first name I guessed to was ok for me to do the same".</p><p>Obi Wan nodded he could understand that. But he knew he had to keep an eye on Harry. He still didn't control his feelings and emotions as well as a Jedi was supposed to. That alone was the reason why he wasn't a Jedi Knight.</p><p>Then all of a sudden Harry whirled around. He sprinted into Padme's room his hand flying to his lightsaber. Obi Wan followed after him and could only watch as Harry activated his lightsaber and sliced at something near Padme's neck. The senator woke with a start and looked around. Then Obi wan noticed what harry had killed. Bugs. They were mechanic insects designed to kill somebody with poison. Obi Wan looked out the window and say a recon droid. He leapt out the window and held onto it. Harry knew why, it would lead them to the person who wanted to kill Padme. He stood up and sprinted to a hangar just as some guards and assistants ran into Padme's room.</p><p>Harry ran to the hangar and got out a speeder and flew around the city trying to spot Obi Wan. He eventually spotted him and flew underneath the recon droid. Obi Wan spotted his apprentice below him and let go. He landed in the passenger seat of the speeder. And Harry went up to maximum speed. Harry was a beautiful pilot. Effortlessly fast he would weave in and out of traffic and never hit anything. However he was incredibly reckless. And did stupid dives all the time. But this time he didn't they just followed the recon droid. Obi Wan had never seen Harry more focused than what he was right now. Even when Harry had saved Obi Wan.</p><p>They followed the recon droid for ages, but then eventually they saw it land by a speeder. As the speeder took off Harry hatched a plan. He followed it at a distance for a time until they were in an empty area of the city.</p><p>Then he looked at Obi Wan. "Take the wheel I have a plan". He didn't wait for an answer but leapt out of the driver's seat. Obi Wan dived for the controls and could only dread what crazy plan his Padawan had come up with now.</p><p>Harry landed on the back of the speeder. He went for his hilt but then they started weaving. Obi Wan was a good pilot but not as good as Harry. He shouted to him "Fly Straight"! Then he activated his lightsaber and Obi Wan gulped. Then Harry, taking a step forward with an almighty athletic toss he threw the lightsaber like a javelin straight at the speeder. It went straight through the back, and Harry could tell by the model it had pierced through the engine. He shouted "BULLSEYE". Then he told Obi Wan to move over and Harry was once again the pilot. He flew towards the ground with tremendous speed and they landed and then they looked at their enemies' speeder. It was falling to the ground and they both raised their hands and the lowered the speeder towards the ground with the force and they pulled the driver out.</p><p>It was a woman and she looked at then terror in her eyes. She spoke before they could. "I was hired I only did it for the money". Both Jedi looked at her and knew she was telling the truth.</p><p>Harry then asked. "Who hired you"?</p><p>The woman nodded and spoke, "It was a bounty hunter called"-,</p><p>However she could say no more as a shot was heard and they looked in the sky to see someone flying away on a jetpack. Harry went for his lightsaber but Obi Wan put a hand on his shoulder. They looked at each other and Obi Wan shook his head. Harry nodded and clipped it back to his belt.</p><p>Then they looked at the woman and pullet a dart out of her neck. They had never seen it before. They decided to go back to the Jedi council.</p><p>The next day Obi Wan and Harry were in front of the Jedi council again. Yoda was saying that Obi Wan needed to track down the bounty hunter. However Obi Wan then asked, "What about Senator Amidala"?</p><p>Mace Windu looked at Harry. "Padawan Potter escort the senator back to Naboo she will be safer there".</p><p>Harry nodded but inside his mind was a haze. <em>Him and Padme back on Naboo alone, this will be interesting.</em></p><p>Obi Wan was hesitant about sending Harry on a mission alone, but knew it was the only reasonable way to keep the senator safe. However he was concerned about the friendship between his apprentice and the senator. As they walked out Yoda called to Harry. "Padawan Potter, you leave before need to speak to you I do".</p><p>Harry nodded and they arranged to meet in the meditation room the next day. Harry didn't know what about but a one on one meeting with Yoda could only be something important.</p><p><em>A/N: How was it. I know you could have watched attack of the clones for this chapter but I promise the familiarities stop here. Apart from the core plot obviously. I wonder if you guys can guess what Yoda wants to speak to Harry about. Please review next chapter hopefully up soon.</em></p>
