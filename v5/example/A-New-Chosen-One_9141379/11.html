<h1>11. Chapter 11</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p><em>A/N: Hey guys. It's been a while hasn't it. But I am back. I hope to get back to regular chapter writing after finishing this chapter. Hope you enjoy it. Someone will die in this chapter but who? Will it be Qui Gon or Obi Wan or will it even be a Jedi. Read to find out. By the way Harry says the Queen instead of Padme because he knows about the decoy and to try and remind himself why they can't be together.</em></p><p>Harry sat on the ship thinking about the mission and the planet they were going to. He really wanted to help save Naboo but he knew it would be tough. Harry, Kit, Qui Gon and Obi Wan could only help the queen but not fight a war for her. If the mission was a success Naboo would be free again, and people would have their home back. Padme would have her home back.</p><p><em>Padme. </em>He sighed as he thought of her. They had shared many great times on Naboo together but had both known deep down they would be forced to go their separate ways. But it still hurt. Harry knew he would always love her and knew that he would be forced to carry this around for the rest of his life. He had betrayed the code and didn't care. His times with Padme had been the best times of his life, but he knew they had to end. He stood up took a deep breath and walked to the Queen's room on the ship. He had no idea how they were supposed to win the battle. Naboo had no army, and there surely were only a few guards left after Captain Panaka sacrificed himself.</p><p>The door opened to the Queen's room and Harry sat beside Obi Wan while people talked. Harry realised they were talking about what he had been thinking. How were they going to win the battle with few fighters? They had pilots but they obviously weren't used to close combat. Without any fighters it would be a slaughter. After hearing Qui Gon and Kit Fisto talking for nearly an hour Harry was all for abandoning the mission and going back to Coruscant. There were possibilities that people on Naboo knew how to fight but there were no guarantees that they would. What they really needed was exactly what Naboo didn't have; an Army.</p><p>Harry looked at the handmaiden he knew to be Padme. She caught his eye pretty much straight away and she gave him a sad smile, and he knew she was thinking along the same lines as him. Without a plan and fighters they would all be killed and Naboo would be lost. Harry looked away from her, and ran a hand through his hair. Even the masters had stopped talking now and had sat down to think about what to do. Everyone was trying to think of something, then Harry noticed the Gungan Jar-Jar Binks. Then he remembered studying Gungan's once with his friends. He remembered while they didn't enjoy fighting they were warriors. They were meant to have a big army. If they were willing to fight for Naboo then they would have something to fight with. He stood up and the Queen looked at him. "Young Jedi you have something to say".</p><p>Harry cast a split seconds glimpse over at Padme then back at the Queen. "Yes, your highness". He cleared his throat, "I remember when I was a Padawan studying Gungun's native to your planet. Apparently they are warriors, and have a grand army. If they agree to fight with us then we have a chance against the trade federation". He bowed to the Queen and sat down.</p><p>The Queen nodded at Harry, "Thank you young Jedi", then she looked over at Jar-Jar. "Jar-Jar Binks is this true"?</p><p>The tall Gungan stood up and swallowed, "Yesa, your highness".</p><p>The Queen nodded again. "Very well if they agree to fight with us we may have a chance. Jar-Jar do you think they will"?</p><p>Jar-Jar swallowed again, "Me dunno, your Highness, if they been attacked, then maybe, but if not, Mesa don't think so".</p><p>The Queen nodded again. "Very well if the Gungan's agree to fight we have a big chance of succeeding, we just have to hope there are fighters alive on the planet. This meeting is over".</p><p>With that everyone stood up bowed to the Queen and walked out. However before the door closed he turned around and saw the Queen look over at Padme with an ugly grimace on her face. Then just for a moment Harry met Padme's eye and she smiled at him, a sad smile. Once again Harry felt the urge to hug her but knew he couldn't. He now knew what his master meant by falling in love as a Jedi is torture.</p><p>As Harry walked away and back to his seat in the main room of the ship, he hadn't noticed his master watching him. Kit Fisto now knew exactly what was going on. Harry had fallen for the Queen. Not the decoy, the real one. He didn't know if Queen Amidala returned his feelings but judging by her actions on Naboo she did. Kit Fisto sighed, he needed to have a talk with his Padawan before this consumed him. He remembered all too well what it was like when he had fallen for Aayla. He had been warned before they became master and apprentice that Harry did have a rebellious streak. However he had always seemed loyal to the code on the missions Kit had seen him on, he now knew what master Yoda meant. Harry was the Chosen One, if he fell victim to the dark side it would mean serious trouble for all of existence.</p><p>Due to the fact Harry was the Chosen One Kit had been surprised that Harry had not been assigned Master Windu who was stricter than Kit and therefore better at keeping him in line or Ki Adi Mundi who was trained by Yoda himself.</p><p>Kit sighed stood up and walked towards the room where Harry was currently meditating.</p><p>He cleared his throat and Harry stood up and bowed and Kit returned the action. Kit sighed again "Harry I think we need to talk".</p><p>Harry nodded and sat down beside his master. Kit locked the door and soundproofed it. Then looked Harry straight in the eye, "Harry I am going straight to the point here, do you or do you not have feelings for Queen Amidala"?</p><p>Harry swore mentally and looked down. Kit then became stern, "Harry answer me". He said.</p><p>Harry looked up took a deep breath, knowing there was no way out of this, and nodded. Not looking his master in the eye.</p><p>Kit Fisto sighed in frustration and resisted the urge to bang his head against the wall. He muttered some swear words under his breath, then looked back at his apprentice. "Ok, does she know or return your feelings".</p><p>Harry blushed and from then on Kit knew the answer to both those Questions. He swore out loud this time and banged his fist upon the table. "Ok Harry I want one more answer did you act upon those feelings"?</p><p>Harry took a deep breath summoning his courage and looked at his master straight in the eye this time, "Yes we did, we did about a week and a half after arriving on Naboo just after I saved her life".</p><p>Kit was glad the door was soundproof. Because that snapped his patience he stood up and bellowed at Harry. "YOU IDIOT, YOU GALACTIC STUPID TOTAL IDIOT! AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR AS A PADAWAN YOU BREAK ONE OF THE MOST SACRED RULES OF THE CODE. YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE EXPELLED FOR THIS, AND I COULD FACE A HEARING ABOUT NOT WATCHING YOU CLOSLEY ENOUGH"!</p><p>Harry however did not back down, he looked at his master and spoke. He didn't shout but spoke with a tone that could honestly scare Master Yoda. "Don't you think I know that? Don't you think those thoughts went through my head before acting upon my feelings. And Master you broke that rule to and as a Master so that in theory makes it worse. You swore not to act upon your feelings. I did act upon mine but after this mission is over I will probably never see her again so she won't get in the way of me being a Jedi".</p><p>That had shut Kit's mouth. Everything Harry had said had been true. He collapsed down in his chair. "Your right Harry I am sorry. I was stupid thinking you hadn't thought about the consequences. Well I think that so long as you promise that she won't get in the way of you doing your duty to the Jedi Order, then I won't go to the council about it".</p><p>Harry grinned slightly "Really, you mean it? Thank you master I won't let you down".</p><p>Kit smiled too, "Good, well now that's done I need to go check on the mission".</p><p>Kit stood up and walked to the door. However before he walked out Harry called him back, "Master me falling for Padme wasn't because you didn't watch me closely enough. It would have happened anyway, it wasn't your fault".</p><p>Kit had no words to respond to that but just smiled and left the room.</p><p>The ship landed on Naboo far away from the palace. Near the lake, so that Jar-Jar could find his people. Harry sat in the mist next to Obi Wan thinking about what his master said. He looked across at Padme who was talking with the decoy Queen. He knew they were trying to find anyone willing to help fight.</p><p>After a while Jar-Jar Emerged alone, saying that the Gungan city was deserted. However he led them to a sacred place where after some tough negotiating and Padme revealing herself as Queen, they managed to get Boss Nass to join them in their plan.</p><p>So finally after much talking and being able to find some volunteers and some guards who survived to help fight. They had a plan. The Gungan's would fight a mock battle to help cause a distraction so The Queen and some fighters and the Jedi could get into the Palace and capture the Viceroy of the trade federation.</p><p>However inside the Palace unknown to the Jedi there was a talk going on between a Sith Lord and his Apprentice. "Darth Maul, they will be no match for you, but make sure you kill the boy. I don't care what else you do but kill the boy. He could be a danger if he grows stronger and more powerful. Just kill the boy".</p><p>The Sith Apprentice bowed his head, "Whatever your bidding my master". And he walked silently off, leaving the Holo-projected Sith lord with the two trade federation separatists.</p><p>Harry waited with his master just outside the Palace entrance. Padme was talking with the pilots about how to blow up the droid control ship. However there was no possible way to get past the deflector shields. Then Harry had an idea. He walked up to the group and Padme looked at him her face showing no emotion. "Young Jedi you want to say something"?</p><p>Harry nodded and spoke, "Um I have a way of blowing up the control ship your highness". He looked at the group of Pilots. "Who would you say is the fastest pilot out of you guys"?</p><p>Everyone instantly looked at the Pilot who Harry guessed to be the leader, due to his difference in uniform. "Well how about you try and blow it up from the inside".</p><p>They looked at each other. Then the leader looked at Harry, "Well that is very risky, but if all else fails I think we could give it a try".</p><p>The other pilots nodded and murmured their agreement, then the Queen looked around at them all. "Very well it's settled I suggest we all get in positions" The Pilots bowed and walked off to find a good position. Padme turned around, but her eyes met Harry's for a moment. She looked at him with raw emotion in her eyes. Harry felt sadness wash through his body, this could be the last time they were remotely alone together.</p><p>Padme walked off to find a good place to take cover. She was blinking to keep the tears out of her eyes. She hated the fact that she had to hide her feelings, but it was the best for both of them.</p><p>Harry took position behind his master and gripped his hilt in his hand. He buried his feelings down and focused all of his force on getting this mission done. This was the best thing to do.</p><p>A huge explosion went off and battle droids started running out into the courtyard. The guards, pilots and Padme and her handmaidens started firing. Harry and the other Jedi activated there lightsabers and the battle begun. Harry slashed droids down with his lightsaber, and along with the three other Jedi combined with the shots from the others the fight was over quickly.</p><p>The team ran through the halls of Theed Palace, shooting down droids as they went. The Jedi went around the outside of the group, blocking any shot that was made by the droids. Once again Harry admired Padme's skill with a blaster. Eventually they reached the hangar. However there were massive groups of battle droids. The group split off. The Jedi ran straight at the droid slicing through them relentlessly. The guards and volunteers, took cover behind pillars and walls, whereas the pilots ran to the fighters. They quickly took off and went to fight a battle in space.</p><p>Harry and Obi Wan fought together, they dominated the battle droids fell before them. The battle was long and hard, but eventually the last droid fell.</p><p>Padme looked around at them all, "come on let's get the viceroy". Everyone nodded and ran towards the door, but it opened before they got there and what they saw made Harry's blood run cold.</p><p>What he saw was something awful. It had a red and black face and horns protruding out of its head. His black cloak made him look like the devil. A guard raised his blaster and was about to pull the trigger but, he threw off his cloak and pulled out a lightsaber. However this was not a normal lightsaber, like Yux's it was double bladed. Now Harry's blood froze in his veins. This was a Sith lord. According to the rule of two there was always two, no more, no less. The Sith had returned after a millennium.</p><p>Kit and Qui-Gon stepped forward, "we'll handle this". Padme nodded, "We'll take the long way". The Rest of the group ran off, leaving the four Jedi. They threw off their cloaks and their hilts flew into their hands. Harry looked at the creature, whatever it was, he had never studied it. He was scared, he could die, any of them could. It looked back at him straight in the eye and leapt at him.</p><p>Harry reacted with lightning fast reflexes. He raised his Lightsaber into a block position and moved back slightly. The Sith landed in front of him and launched an attack. Harry blocked the blade, but was nearly caught off guard having to block two. Harry may of thought he was a good fighter, but he had nothing on the Sith. After four lightning fast strikes against his blade, Kit and Obi Wan moved into help. Then Qui Gon went to strike him from behind, but the double bladed lightsaber managed to block it and Maul leapt in front of them and span his blade around.</p><p>Obi Wan leapt at him, and launched a barrage of attacks at Maul, who blocked them easily. The three other Jedi joined him, and Maul was eventually forced out of the hangar</p><p>With four Lightsaber's against him Maul was struggling to block all of them. He knew he needed to even the odds. So as they battled there way on to catwalks Maul leapt up and landed behind the Jedi as he went to deliver the killing blow, Harry span around and blocked the blades. Then he launched an assault of quick attacks against Maul, and eventually found a gap and as he went for the fatal attack, Maul managed to use the force to throw him along the catwalk and fall down to another level.</p><p>Then the other three Jedi attacked and Maul managed to block them easily enough as they were all slower than him. He then launched an explosive kick at them. Qui Gon and Obi Wan fell off the catwalk but Kit managed to grab the edge of it and haul himself back up. Maul instantly restarted the fight and the two were duelling ferociously. Kit was a fine dueller but Maul was aggressive and Kit could hardly keep up with the speed of his attacks. The more Kit blocked, the more he was pushed back along the corridor and was becoming more, and more tired.</p><p>Harry meanwhile had regained consioussness and leapt up to the catwalk. He saw Kit and Maul fighting and could tell that Kit needed help. He sprinted along the catwalk and leapt over the two duellists and landed behind Maul. As he went to strike him down, Maul saw him out of the corner of his eye and blocked the strike from Kit's lightsaber. Then he span around and blocked Harry's strike with so much power Harry was pushed back a bit. Maul saw this as his chance when Harry had his guard down and was off balance. He went to kill him but saw Kit about to stab him from behind. Maul had, had enough he span round again and used one blade to ferociously block Kit's strike and then followed through with the other blade and stabbed him through the chest.</p><p>Maul pulled the blade out and heard Harry let out a terrible blood curdling scream! Kit stumbled forward slightly collapsed onto his knees and gave one last dying breath. Then he fell forward, Kit was dead!</p><p>Maul turned around and looked at Harry and grinned a horrible twisted grin. That was all Harry needed. His anger overwhelmed his rational thought and leapt at Maul. Harry had not had much training with the more aggressive styles that Dez used, but now that was all he was using.</p><p>He struck and Maul with anger and hate, his strikes had power and twinned with his natural attacking speed they caught Maul by surprise and they eventually fought off the catwalk into a laser walled security hallway.</p><p>While this was happening Obi Wan and Qui Gon had just finished off some Droidekas that had doubtless been sent by Maul. Then they jumped up onto the catwalk and saw the fight going on. They broke into a run and sprinted towards the duel. However Obi Wan was concentrating so much on helping Harry that he didn't see Kit's body whereas his master did.</p><p>Qui Gon stopped when he saw Kit's body and he fell to his knees in shock. He couldn't believe Kit was dead. He was one of the finest duellists in the galaxy. He turned his body over and looked at him for a second. He knew he needed to help Harry but he reached over and closed Kit's eyes. Then he stood up and went to help Harry not noticing that the laser walls had been activated.</p><p>It was not until he was a bit up the corridor that Obi Wan noticed his master was not with him. He turned around and saw his master crouching over something. He went to go have a quick look then the laser walls activated. He was trapped. Immediately he looked over his shoulder at harry and saw that he had been separated from Maul and was taking deep breaths to recover. It was then he knew what had happened. Kit Fisto had died. Harry now wasn't looking to protect Naboo he was looking for revenge! He only could hope h had kept control of his anger.</p><p>Harry saw the laser wall activate and separate him and Maul. He looked at him in the eye and Maul was giving him a look that said I am better than you. It was then Harry thought, <em>what am I doing? I am better than this I shouldn't strike him down in anger. </em>Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes he used the force to calm himself down. This would be the only chance he got.</p><p>Meanwhile on the other side of the Palace fierce blaster fire was going on between Padme and her squad of guards. They needed to capture the Viceroy, he could be leaving right now. She looked at her group of guards and gave the order to stop firing. They did just that and as they stopped the droids did too. They stepped out from cover dropping their blasters as they went. Padme had a plan, they would lead them to the viceroy. She pulled a special grenade out of her belt and hastily hid it so it wouldn't be seen.</p><p>However up in space the Pilots didn't know what to do. Everything they had tried had failed. The deflector shield was to strong. Then the leader remembered something. He looked at the astromech droid. "R2 set the course for the hangar of that command ship I remember what the boy said". He then flipped his headset down and spoke to the remainder of his team. "Bravo Team remember what that young Jedi said about blowing it up from the inside, cover me I am going in"! Not prepared to listen to complaints he flipped his headset up and went for it! He saw the other pilots covering him and winced slightly whenever a ship got destroyed. Then finally amidst all the chaos and missile fire he made it inside the command ship. Not wanting to hang around he pressed the button to fire off his remaining missiles and waited. Then they hit the main reactor and the Pilot spun his ship around and flew out of there cheering with the rest of the team when he got out and watched it blow up as they flew back to Naboo.</p><p>Meanwhile back on Naboo Padme had been shown to the throne room and Viceroy. "Well this can finally come to an end your highness, time to stop the suffering and sign the treaty". Then a blaster was heard and it was the decoy Queen, Viceroy sent the battle droids after her but they stopped working after less than two steps and Padme smiled. The control ship had been destroyed. She went to the battle droids and picked up their blasters. Then she pointed it at the Viceroy and the others did the same. "Now Viceroy we will discuss a new treaty".</p><p>In the laser Corridor the walls were still active. Maul was pacing as if he was a caged animal, Harry was trying to keep his emotions under his control. Obo Wan and Qui Gon were concentrating on getting to harry the moment these walls deactivated. Maul was two walls from the end and Harry was one behind. Obi Wan was then four behind and Qui Gon was behind the first one two behind Obi Wan.</p><p>Harry still had his eyes closed in deep thought. <em>Ok just keep calm and stay in control, focus on speed I can match him for that. He will make a mistake he has to. Everyone does. </em>Harry opened his eyes and looked at Maul. He knew he would hate him but he used the force and let go of all his emotion, he controlled them they didn't control him. He looked at Maul calmly, preparing himself.</p><p>Then the walls deactivated and everyone reacted instantly. Maul leapt into Harry and started attacking him with quick powerful strikes. Harry was surprised how much easier he found it to block him when he was calm. He remained focused and blocked the two blades attacking when he could.</p><p>Obi Wan and Qui Gon started sprinting up the corridor which Harry and Maul made it out of quickly. For a moment Obi wan thought he would make it but he was a split seconds too slow and the walls activated leaving him stuck behind the last one, while his master was one behind him. All they could do was watch as Harry fought for his life.</p><p>Harry used all the speed he could blocking Mauls attacks. As a youngling they hardly ever did concentrate on blocking against a lightsaber, and the only time he had done it against a double one, was sparing against Yux. He was finding it harder and harder. But then as Maul launched four lightning speed strikes against Harry, he left a gap. Harry went for it. He raised his lightsaber and went to slash through the side of Mauls stomach but Maul saw it and went to block but he made another mistake. Instead of Harry's blade hitting his Harry raised his lightsaber slightly and severed through the hilt. Cutting the lightsaber in two. One half went flying across to the edge of the room useless. Now Maul only had one blade. Harry went to attack him again and Maul blocked him but now Harry had the advantage, Maul wasn't very good with one blade. As Harry struck down on his blade again Maul managed to counter with a powerful block and the two started duelling again ferociously across the room. Then after countless clashes between the lightsaber's Harry saw an opening and tried to kick Maul but this was a mistake. Maul was good with martial arts and blocked him then knocked him of balance stabbing him in the leg as Harry fell to the ground.</p><p>Maul looked at Harry, whose blood had turned to ice in fear, he couldn't fight anymore. Maul gave him his twisted smile <em>two down two to go, </em>he thought. He smiled again and raised his blade into the air. Then he swung it down and Harry managed to roll out of the way in time. Obi Wan and Qui Gon were hoping, praying to the force that the walls deactivated and their prayers were answered. As Maul went to stab Harry again the walls deactivated and the split second they did, Obi Wan leapt at Maul. Harry saw him and as Maul looked up he froze for a second and the pause cost him his life. Obi Wan sliced through Maul cutting him in half. Maul looked Obi Wan in the eye for a moment then fell back through the large hole in the floor.</p><p>Obi Wan looked down for a moment then deactivated his lightsaber and went to Harry. Qui Gon was healing his leg with the force Obi Wan sat beside him and Harry buried his head in his hands. And his body started to shake quietly. Obi Wan looked at Harry for a minute then put an arm around him in a one armed hug as Harry cried quietly. Obi Wan knew why, he felt responsible for Kit's death which Obi Wan thought was ridiculous then again Obi Wan put himself in Harry's place and Obi Wan knew he would do the same.</p><p>After fixing his leg Qui Gon stood up and walked briskly down to fetch Kit's body. Supporting him all the way Obi Wan stood up and led Harry back to the main Palace.</p><p><em>A/N: Phew! Glad that is finally done, I will include Kit's funeral and some other things directly continuing from this in the next chapter. But it felt right to end this one here. I hope it was good the fight scene I found really tough to write. The next one will be up shortly and I really hope this was worth the wait again sorry about that. I had hoped to get this up at the weekend but I was away and forgot my charger. Please Review </em></p>
