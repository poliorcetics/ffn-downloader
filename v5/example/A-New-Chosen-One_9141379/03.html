<h1>3. Chapter 3</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p>Chapter 3</p><p><em>A/N: Cheers for the reviews guys and over a thousand views in four days so thanks. This will just be a small chapter about Harry being a padawan and learning the differences think of it as a late Easter present from me. Next chapter will be the main story.</em></p><p><em>I own nothing of George Lucas' world</em></p><p><em>Continuing straight from the last chapter</em></p><p>Harry turned around and walked into his quarters, as the door closed he looked around.</p><p>It was as plain as he could imagine, the walls and the floor were white and there was no decoration at all. At one side of the room stood a wardrobe and a chest of drawers while in the middle there was a large single bed that had white sheets. There was another door in the room and through it was an en-suite bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet. There were two large windows going down the walls beside the bed, and next to the bed a lightsaber holder and a small bedside cabinet completed the furniture for the room.</p><p>Harry picked up his bag and began to unpack. He hung his tunics in the wardrobe, put his trousers in the drawers, put the picture on his bedside cabinet and toiletries in the bathroom.</p><p>Glancing at the lightsaber holder for a moment, he looked down at his lightsaber; he badly needed a new one, this one was so low on power it barely had its glow anymore. He put it into the holder and collapsed down onto his bed. This was going to be his new home for at least the next five years. He knew why the Jedi kept it plain; because if they didn't they would become to attached to the temple.</p><p>All of a sudden he felt hot tears run down his face. He tried to wipe them away but they kept coming. It wasn't that he didn't want to be a Jedi but now it seemed real. He was going to spend the rest of his life defending the galaxy. There would be no more time to mess about with his friends or bad mouth the Jedi masters. Now he was on the road to becoming a Jedi and even though it was the first step he had to live his life completely by their rules now. The rules were more relaxed with the younglings but now he was a padawan and a proper Jedi, he would have to live his life to the code completely. Above all of this he was really going to miss his friends.</p><p>Then he heard a knock at the door. He managed to say, "Come in." He heard the door open and he looked up expecting to see Master Yoda or Kit Fisto, but to his surprise, it was the padawan he had seen earlier; Obi Wan Kenobi.</p><p>Obi Wan sat beside him and looked at him. He said nothing for a minute but then said five words, "It's okay let it out."</p><p>Harry couldn't hold it in any longer and let the barriers down. Tears came thick and fast into his lap. He was expecting the older Jedi to mock or laugh at him, but Obi Wan said nothing but just let him cry. He put a gentle hand on Harry's shoulder and waited for him to stop.</p><p>Finally after about ten minutes Harry had calmed down he looked at the older Jedi, "How did you know?"</p><p>It took all of Obi Wan's self-control to suppress a chuckle. "I've been a padawan for nearly ten years and almost every, if not every single, new Jedi who comes here and is upset when they are first accepted. I know it's scary; all this sudden change and you are going to miss your clan, there is no getting around that but it will get better, it seems impossible now I know, but it will get better. I felt exactly as you did when I first became a padawan I thought I would never make a good Jedi, but my master helped me through it and so will yours, and all of us padawan's are here to help you too."</p><p>Harry looked up at him, "You mean that?"</p><p>Obi Wan did give a slight chuckle at these words, "Of course I do, Master Fisto will help you because he was in your shoes once and us padawans are like a big clan, we may not eat or sleep together like the youngling clans do but we look out for each other like the youngling clans do."</p><p>Harry looked at him and saw truth in his eyes, "Thanks you Obi Wan, that's really nice to hear."</p><p>Obi Wan chuckled again, "I know how you feel, I felt the same way when an experienced padawan talked to me on my first night, now come on go to bed, you have a big day tomorrow. You have a lot of things to talk about with your master and you need your energy, the padawan day is a lot more energetic than the younglings day."</p><p>Harry nodded shook hands with the older padawan and after he walked out he pulled of his tunic brushed his teeth and went to bed excited about what adventures being a Jedi may bring. He knew it was only the first step but he was on the road to becoming a Jedi legend and fulfilling his destiny which was destroying the Sith.</p><p><em>A/N: I know its short but this was more of a filler chapter really I just wanted to give obi wan a bit of a role. The next chapter will be longer and Padme will be in it. It will be about six months after this and Harry's friends will be padawans and he will have a new lightsaber and will have gone on some missions. Review please.</em></p>
