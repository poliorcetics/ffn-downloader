<h1>7. Chapter 7</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p>Chapter 7</p><p><em>A/N: SORRY IT'S BEEN A WHILE REAL LIFE HAPPENED BUT I AM DONE WITH SCHOOL FOREVER!</em></p><p><em>THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE REVIEWS I LOVE YOU GUYS!</em></p><p><em>On another note I was planning on making u guys sweat but as I am sick of answering the question Anakin WILL NOT be in this story. There is a reason for this; He was the chosen one and was conceived due to Midi-chlorians but as he is not the chosen one in this he would not be alive so yeah if u wanted Anakin sorry. ALSOARE THERE ANY BETA'S HAPPY TO BECOME A READER FOR THIS. IF THERE ARE PM PLEASE!</em></p><p><em>But enough of this long authors note here u go.</em></p><p>Harry woke up in his palace room on Naboo. Normally he was a slow starter, but today that was different. He literally leapt out of bed and pulled on his jet-black trousers, ebony undershirt and coal coloured tunic. He then attached his belt, grabbed his lightsaber and laced up his boots before he sprinted out of the room.</p><p>Harry arrived at his master's room and before he even knocked Kit opened the door and ushered him inside. Harry looked at his master; he looked like he hadn't slept and his eyes had dark rings under them and Harry noticed the holoprojector sitting on the table.</p><p>Harry sat on the sofa and Kit sat opposite him and rubbed his eyes. Then Kit looked at him and spoke. "Harry I know what you are wondering and the answer is we are staying. Apparently the trade federation has been legalised to have the blockade increased and the masters are wary of something bigger, even if the federation types are cowards. They have also allowed me to look for the old king. But Harry, the planet is going to be in scandal after last night, just be cautious and remember use the force; it could save your life as easily as your weapon."</p><p>Harry nodded and kept his expression to a slight frown and a hand to his forehead. But inside he was feeling elated! He was getting more time with Padme! He stood up bowed to his master and left the room.</p><p>As he walked across to the lake Harry noticed that the atmosphere seemed more stressed than before. There were more guards everywhere and people were wandering around in groups. The sun was shining down but it seemed like a miserable, grey day. Harry also noticed that people were smiling at him and nodding to him, especially the guards. Harry wondered why this was, but then remembered that they now knew he was a Jedi and how he had helped save over one hundred lives the night before. He reached the spot by the lake and started skipping rocks, waiting for Padme.</p><p>After about ten minutes, he felt a familiar presence and he spun around just as Padme ran at him and engulfed him in her arms. Harry wrapped his arms around her and she responded by gripping on to him tighter.</p><p>After a few minutes of just holding each other Padme pulled her head back and looked at him with pleading eyes. "Harry please tell me you don't have to leave today, I am not sure I could handle it if you did."</p><p>Harry looked at her and gave her a small smile, and shook his head. Padme's eyes shone with happiness and she buried her head into his chest, "Thank the force you don't." She said her voice muffled. Harry laughed silently and the two of them sat down. Padme snuggled into his side and Harry wrapped an arm around her as he used the force to skip rocks across the lake. Harry knew it was dangerous but right now he didn't care, the two of them were happy and that was all that mattered.</p><p>A few hours later, Harry put his lightsaber back on his belt and left the training room. Sweat was running down his face and he ached all over. His master was organising a search operation to search for the old king, so it was up to him to train for now.</p><p>As he walked across the gardens to his room he thought about the mission. He had liked how it had gone. Of course Padme was a big reason for that, but his daily routine when he wasn't with Padme was getting a little bit repetitive and he was getting bored. They had been here just over a month and it was the same thing every day and he craved more action than the tyrant guards he had fought the day before. It was so frustrating that he hadn't been able to show what he could do. He pulled out his blade and swung it through some large rocks, as an outlet for his frustration. Then he picked one of them up and flung it across the palace garden where it landed noisily in the lake.</p><p>Then he heard a shout behind him, "Oi, Jedi!"</p><p>Harry turned around and saw a boy walking towards him. He looked about two years older than Harry and had wavy brown hair blown to one side of his forehead and was a fair bit taller than Harry. Then to his confusion Harry noticed the boy seemed angry at him.</p><p>The boy reached him and stood towering over him his fists bunched, "I've been looking for you; I have watched you ever since you arrived and I haven't liked what I have seen. Do you know what I have seen Jedi? I have seen you get very close to our future Queen. Well let me tell you, <em>Jedi</em>," he spat venomously, "She completely ignores everyone else now and I don't like that, she is MINE!" He shouted the last word and then, out of nowhere, threw a punch at Harry!</p><p>However Harry saw it coming and leapt backwards, landing neatly. He threw off his cloak and adopted a fighting stance. He wanted to beat this boy to a pulp but quickly took a few deep breaths to calm down and gain control of his emotions again. If he didn't the mission would be over and he did not want to act like Dez. He knew he could beat this boy easily. The boy threw him a sneer and ran at him. Harry however was much quicker and as the boy reached him and threw a wild punch. Harry blocked him easily and the force of the block threw the older boy back a few steps. Then he threw a kick and a punch but Harry blocked the kick, as he blocked the punch he quickly grabbed the other boy's wrist and threw him over his shoulder and let him fall to the ground on his back. Then he karate chopped him in the ribs, hard! Cutting of his wind and he breathed in hard and rolled over onto his side.</p><p>Harry grabbed the boy's shoulder and pulled him over glaring at his beaten opponent. "Listen you arrogant piece of crap, I don't know where you got the idea that Padme belongs to you, but believe me she doesn't. I suggest you leave me alone and if you pick a fight with me again I won't be so kind. Oh and if you think of running off and telling everyone about what you have seen you won't." As he spoke he waved his hand lazily over the boy and his eyes adopted a dreamy look and his head fell back. Harry grinned stood up and walked back to his room. Yes that had been a nice change from his routine.</p><p>The sun was gradually setting over the lake on Naboo and Harry Potter was in one of the best moods he ever had ever been in. He was sitting by the lake in the garden with Padme in his arms and the bright orange sun shining across the lake casting shadows over the trees. The air smelt sweet and there was the sound of insects in the air. Padme had her head leaning on his shoulder and his arms were wrapped around her waist and her sweet smelling hair was hanging in his face. She sighed contently and snaked a hand gently up his stomach and she could feel the faint outline of a six-pack and she smiled mischievously. Harry looked down and her with a faint blush. He gently reached across and took her hand in his and gave it a squeeze. Padme smiled again but this time it wasn't one of mischief but of true happiness. She leaned back against him and Harry kissed the top of her head.</p><p>After a few minutes of silence Harry looked back down at Padme and spoke seriously, "Padme, earlier I saw this guy he looked about fifteen, brown hair and he was an arrogant idiot said you were his do you know him?"</p><p>Padme looked at him and nodded, "Yes Harry, I am ashamed to say I do, his name is Seki Kzeco. I agree with you that he is and arrogant person, he has a huge crush on me and as they say love blinds you. But there is no need to worry, I will never return his feelings."</p><p>Harry smiled and continued, "Well the thing, is I met him today and he tried to pick a fight with me but he came of worse I didn't hurt him but I made sure he knew to leave you alone and forget about us."</p><p>Padme cracked a huge smile she knew he had used a Jedi mind trick. She launched her arms around him and kissed him on the lips and pulled away before Harry could deepen it. Harry smiled. He wrapped her arms back around her, she snuggled back into his side and she knew from then on no words were needed. The two of them stayed out until the sky was an inky black and the guards were wandering around the garden with an increased number than before and they both knew why. A small distance from Padme's house Harry kissed her on the cheek and she hugged him fiercely. When they broke apart Padme kissed him one more time and gave his hand a squeeze and then went to her house waved at him from the door and went inside.</p><p>Harry watched her go with a small smile on his face. He started to walk back to his room. Deep down however he knew this couldn't last and shouldn't be happening anyway. The new ruler would be announced tomorrow and Harry would bet his lightsaber it was Padme. He sighed sadly as he opened the door to his room and collapsed on his bed and fell asleep almost straight away.</p><p>Harry and his master stood in the garden in the palace far away from everyone else. It was now too hot to train in the castle so Kit had taken them outside. The two had just finished some martial arts drills and were exhausted. Harry had sprinted down to the lake and had splashed the water over his face before deciding to pull his undershirt off and immersed his upper body in the cool water. When he eventually came up for air he felt a presence behind him and he knew who it was. He jumped up and called his lightsaber to him. He grabbed it and ignited the dark blade. He spun around just in time and the green blade of his master collided with his. The pair dueled furiously. Kit had the duelist's skill that Harry could not match, but his speed was far superior to his masters and countered and blocked easily. Eventually, Harry clashed blades with his master with power and caught his master of balance with a few more high-speed strikes before spinning around with his foot high in the air, and kicked his master to the ground. He pointed his lightsaber in front of his face for a few seconds then he cracked a smile. He de-activated his lightsaber and pulled his master up who looked at him impressed.</p><p>"Well done my young Padawan, good awareness of your surroundings, not distracted and quick to react I have to say I'm impressed, now get back and have a shower".</p><p>Harry nodded bowed to his master and sprinted off back to his room. He wondered how Padme was getting on and hoped that she would become Queen. Naboo needed a monarch like her.</p><p>After his shower Harry collapsed onto his bed letting the sun toast his body up. Then he heard a knock at the door. He called used the force to open the door and his master stepped in. He looked at Harry in the eye and said, "Harry get dressed now, we need your help to look for the old king, I know it is sudden but we could use somebody like you. Get dressed and meet me in the throne room."</p><p>Harry jumped up and put on his dark tunic and black trousers and knee high boots, he left his cloak as it was too hot. He put his belt on, clipping his lightsaber and other equipment to it. Then with a sweeping glance at the room, he walked out the door, slamming it closed behind him.</p><p>He walked to the throne room and found it full of guards. He saw a large hologram of Naboo in an overhead view. His master was bent over it along with Captain Panaka and a few other generals. He also saw a couple of people who looked like explorers. When his master saw him, he called him over and Harry knelt over the map. Captain Panaka looked over at him.</p><p>"Ah, young Jedi, good to see you have arrived, let me fill you in on what has happened so far. We split into ten groups of five and we agreed to search around certain areas. So far we have looked over the west side of the forest," he gestured to a green area on the map, "And these explorers kindly explored the more dangerous areas of the jungle and the more populated part of the planet. The rest of the guards scanned the mountains and there was nothing anywhere."</p><p>Harry nodded then looked up, "So we have little place left to look?" The guard grimaced and nodded slowly. Then Harry pointed to a large part of the map, "What about this part it looks fairly large he could be there." When he looked up at the expression on Panaka's face he knew he already knew that.</p><p>"That, Harry, is the wasteland, nothing grows there at all; it is just a large expanse of dry cracked mud, nothing at all can survive there, not even the old king would have been as crazy to go in there."</p><p>Harry then said, "Well maybe he is there. Let's think about this, he made run for it and maybe he would have run into there. Look it leads into the forest and maybe he went in there and tried to get in there but never made it out."</p><p>The guards and the explorers stared at him then Panaka muttered, "You know… that does make sense, he was in a rush to get out so maybe just maybe he did." Then he turned to the others, "Okay guards, explorers, new plan; we are going to look in the wastelands and that is a big place, just over five hundred miles from one end to the other. So if we abandon the groups and we head out in a line on speeders we should cover it easily in a day."</p><p>Harry walked out with his master. He mounted his speeder pulled down his goggles and looked at his team leader who was an explorer. Captain Panaka looked back at the rest of the men and gave a nod to start. They sped out in a line side by side they all gave each other the thumbs up and they went to maximum speed.</p><p>Harry felt at home on a speeder. The bike turned wherever he wanted it to go at his slightest touch, he looked at the dust coming up off of the wastelands. He put the speed up and sped away from the others and they all veered off in different directions looking for the king.</p><p>Harry dismounted his speeder and collapsed down on the wasteland. His arse was aching after six hours on the bike. He was severely dehydrated and he had nothing drink with him. The heat of the sun was getting to him and all sight of the searching party was long gone. He felt in his belt pocket and pulled out a ration cube and forced down the powdery substance. He knew he needed to get out of here but there was nobody around to help him. His mouth was dry and he could feel his body shutting down. Then he remembered his com-link. He reached down and pressed it to his face. "Padawan Potter to Master Kit Fisto assistance is required, my tracking device is turned on assistance required. I am in no condition to travel, assistance required, tracking device turned on". Then he dropped the com-link and collapsed against the speeder breathing hard. The sun was going down but the heat was still unaffected. He could feel a migraine coming on due to the dehydration and hoped his master had heard him. He could feel his eyes closing and himself dropping off.</p><p>Then he was brought back to Naboo by the sound of footsteps. Ignoring his migraine and stood up wobbling slightly as he did so. His hand was resting on his hilt and he looked around. Then he heard another sound of a foot against the ground, and then out of darkness he saw a pair of bright yellow eyes. A blue light flashed before him before darkness claimed him as his body smacked against the ground.</p><p><em>A/N: Sorry for ending here but I wanted to get this up. One word of warning the next chapter will probably be quite short and again a big shout out to my reviewers and sorry it took so long. Again I would like a beta for this story. Please Review</em></p>
