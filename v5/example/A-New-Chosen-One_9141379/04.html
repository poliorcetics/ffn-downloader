<h1>4. Chapter 4</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p><em>Chapter 4</em></p><p><em>A/N: thanks for the reviews guys this chapter Harry has been a padawan for six months and his friends are all padawan's too. Padme will make an appearance in this chapter and Harry has been on a few small missions with Kit Fisto already and has his proper lightsaber. This is six months before the events of the phantom menace.</em></p><p>Harry walked through the halls in the Jedi temple. He had been a padawan for six months now and loved the life he had. Kit was a great master and even though it had been a short time with him Harry had learnt a lot.</p><p>The most useful thing of everything was an increase of form five in lightsaber combat. The reason he had learnt this was so he would to better in one-on-one combat, he was naturally good at the form due to his superior, knowledge of form three. He had focused on the Djem more than Shien, since that concentrated of blocking blaster fire and he was already good at that again due to form three. However Djem focused on lightsaber dueling such as blocks and counter attacks which would be his main help in one-on-one combat. It was a good way of developing good fighting skills without getting aggressive. However since this form of combat required good upper body strength and strong core muscles, over the last four months; under the supervision of his master Harry had undergone an intense physical training program in the temple's fitness centre. Lifting weights, running, exercises such as press-ups and sit-ups. After doing this for four months six days a week and three hours a day, Harry had gained a lot of strength. He still had a thin build because it was how he was naturally built. But he was no longer a skinny twelve year old. He was thirteen now and had large biceps for his thin build and strong chest muscles and the faint definition of a six-pack which he was intent on getting.</p><p>However his agility was as good as ever due to his masters insistence that he kept up his martial arts, the basics of which Master Windu taught them as younglings, and his constant training in form three, to get better at form five and natural fast attacking speed. And thanks to Kit Fisto's mastery of form one of lightsaber combat, he had become better at that too. Which as form one was the essence of all forms of lightsaber combat, it had greatly improved his skill with a lightsaber. Along with teachings of form five, he now was one of the most skilled if not <em>the</em> most skilled padawan in the temple. Overall he could now do much more than he could six months ago. He thanked the Order for giving him Master Fisto.</p><p>In the past six months his friends had become padawan's and had all had their first mission.</p><p>They all had different fighting styles. Dez had a very aggressive fighting style mostly of form four and form seven. It was effective but, Harry and Yux were concerned as was his master; if he got too aggressive in his fighting he could get angry which would lead to hatred: the two most common emotions of the Dark Side. Even Master Yoda was concerned as he had seen Dez struggle to control his emotions in their years as younglings. Because this made him highly susceptible to the Dark Side he had assigned him one of the highest acclaimed Jedi masters in the temple; Plo Koon. That reassured his best friends a great deal: Koon had a strong sense of Justice and was an excellent swords man and would know if Dez took his anger too far and would discipline him in the way of the Jedi.</p><p>However Yux had a rare fighting style. He had a fibre cord linked lightsaber, which could be used as two lightsaber's or a double bladed one. He was skilled in the Jar'Kai fighting style, which involved wielding two lightsaber's or if the lightsaber's were joined together he was an agile warrior and his blades could cause ultimate destruction. On the occasion when he only used on blade however, as it was not his favoured form of combat, he used the Force more than another Jedi would so with one blade he used, form six two which was a duellists style which helped due to the similarity in the style he used when duelling separate blades.</p><p>Prelo used the normal form of combat of form one but he was not as skilled as other padawans. However, he was very attuned with the living force, more so than all other padawans-except Harry due to him being the chosen one-, and most Jedi knights and even one master. This made up for his lack of skill with a lightsaber because he could sense danger more than other Jedi and that gave him an advantage over his opponents.</p><p>Harry walked into the canteen and picked up an apple, a bottle of blue milk and two slices of bread that he popped in a high powered toaster for five seconds. After he was finished he looked around. He saw Yux and Prelo sitting with a girl from their old clan who was named Akaso and was the only human girl from the clan. Harry walked over to his friends and they bumped fists, "Hey guys where's Dez?" Asked Harry not looking at Akaso.</p><p>Yux and Prelo grimaced at him, "Well you know he got back from that mission yesterday?" Said Prelo. Harry nodded, Dez had been sent on a mission last week and he had gotten back and apparently had done a brilliant job, or so he said.</p><p>"Well," said Yux, "Apparently after his master told the council his summary of the mission, Dez was in big trouble. Apparently he left his master and went into a fight on his own, needless to say that the fight was a trap and the people they were trailing got away, by the time they finished fighting and realized they had gone, the bad guys had entered hyperspace and were probably halfway across the galaxy. So he basically lost them the mission for a little action and let his arrogance get in the way."</p><p>Harry nodded his friend had lost the Jedi a target and was getting punished for it. He took a bite of his toast and a swig of his milk and then looked back at his friends and said, "So what's his punishment?"</p><p>His two friends shrugged but Akaso started to speak, "Nice to see you too Harry, he's cleaning out the fitness centre for two weeks then he has been banned from missions for a month."</p><p>Harry smiled and nodded he apologized for not greeting her and asked her about how her life was going since she had become a padawan. Although the Jedi were banned from making attachments, the masters knew with people from your clan; it couldn't be helped since they had grown up together. Harry considered Akaso a sister, and she considered him a brother as she did with every boy from the clan. Although Harry considered the other girls from his clan sisters and the other boys from his clan were like brothers, he was of course closer to Dez and everyone knew that, the two of them were more like twins. As they talked they both agreed that they did not envy Dez's punishment.</p><p>After a while Akaso went to sit with her friends over at the next table and some boys came to sit with Harry, Yux and Prelo. After half an hour, Harry was eating his third apple and then he felt two hands grab his shoulders and knew instantly who it was.</p><p>Harry turned around and stood up to see the grinning face of his master and Harry knew he was in for a wind up, "So young padawan why aren't you wearing your tunic and where is your equipment?"</p><p>Harry smiled at his master, "Sorry Master but after breakfast I was planning on going for a run and then practicing my form five combat and finishing with meditating and a tunic isn't exactly good training clothing for running."</p><p>His master looked at him a serious look on his face, "Well I am sorry my young padawan, but the council has requested an audience with both of us about a mission they are sending us on. Meet me outside the chambers in half an hour and dress properly." With that he turned around a walked off.</p><p>Harry sat back down and saw his friends grinning at him, "What?" He asked.</p><p>Yux who was sitting next to him punched him, "Harry you know when a padawan gets called to the council for a mission, it's a big one. You are such a jammy git you have only had three missions and now you have a big one."</p><p>Harry smiled but said nothing else except, "Ok guys, I will talk to you later." He threw his milk bottle and apple core in the bin and went to his room to change.</p><p>Once in his room Harry pulled of his undershirt and put on a dark brown tunic and black trousers he pulled on his cloak which was also black and pulled on his dark brown boots. (Harry is wearing Anakin's clothes basically I am not very good at describing them). He attached his utility belt to his waist and picked up his lightsaber. He had had the weapon for a while now but the novelty of having his own proper lightsaber had not worn off yet. It had a firebrand hilt, which he thought was really cool and his friends were jealous of as they all had guardian style hilts and thought they were boring. Harry pressed the button and a blue blade ignited, but unlike most lightsabers, it had a black core instead of a white one. Harry clipped it to his belt and made sure his hair was neat. He sighed when he saw it. As a padawan he was required to have short hair. Even though when short his hair was not as messy as when it was long; short hair didn't suit him. He didn't mind the braid he had but he would much rather get rid of it. He tucked the braid on his shoulder, pulled the hood of his cloak up, and headed out.</p><p>Harry waited outside the council chambers with his master. Even though Kit Fisto was on the council, he wasn't allowed in for the time being as this meeting concerned both of them for a mission that was being given to them by the council.</p><p>Harry was leaning against the wall wondering about Dez and his punishment and what sort of mission the council wanted to see him about. He hoped it was for a big one like his friends said, but, as he had only been a padawan for six months, he knew not to get his hopes up.</p><p>Then Kit Fist turned to him, "Harry I am not going to lecture you on how to speak to the masters as you already know that you have to show them the upmost respect at all times. But if I am asked to take a seat on the council when we go in, for the time I am sitting there I am not your master, I am a member of the council and you have to treat me as such."</p><p>Harry looked at his master and nodded, "Yes Master, I understand."</p><p>Kit grinned back at him, "Good."</p><p>A few minutes after this the door opened and they were called in. Harry and Kit stood in the centre of the room and bowed to the masters. Harry looked around and saw that the council was not exactly full. Yoda and master Windu were there of course. He recognised Obi Wan's master Qui-Gon Jinn, then he saw Yux's master Aayla Secura and two other Jedi Masters he knew by sight but had never spoken to so he didn't know their names.</p><p>Mace Windu spoke first, "Padawan Harry, Master Kit Fisto has informed us of your dedication to your training and improvement in your lightsaber skills, he has also told us of your achievement on your missions and your respect for the order so for that we congratulate you."</p><p>The masters nodded their agreement and Harry bowed to them again, "Thank you masters."</p><p>Then Master Yoda spoke, "Young padawan, your hood lower. See your face we must."</p><p>Harry realised he had not lowered his hood and quickly apologised to the masters and pulled his hood down. He tucked the braid behind his ear in an attempt to hide it, and the ancient master gave a small chuckle and said, "Ashamed of your braid you should not be, your skills it shows."</p><p>The other Jedi exchanged a grin, clearly they had seen other padawans do that before and the human Jedi remembered how annoying their braid was. Master Windu directed the conversation again, "Master Kit Fisto, Padawan Harry, we have felt unease within the force recently and we have seen the trade federation step up in activity; they are forming a blockade over Naboo and we worry they will attempt an invasion. We know the separatists are cowards but if there is somebody else in charge of them, we have no idea what may come about. So we are proposing to send you two to Naboo to protect the palace and especially the royal inhabitants. As you may know Master Fisto the elections for a new ruler are taking place next month and the king is very much despised by all of Naboo so it is very strained there at the moment.</p><p>Kit spoke in response, "So, masters, what you are proposing is that me and my padawan go to Naboo and protect the palace if the trade federation decide to invade the planet"?</p><p>Master Yoda and Windu nodded, "Do you accept this mission?" asked Mace Windu.</p><p>Kit looked at his padawan who looked at him and nodded and Kit looked at the masters and nodded too.</p><p>Mace Windu nodded back, "Ok, may the force be with you both. The king knows about this so when you get there someone should be there to greet you."</p><p>The two nodded again to show they understood,</p><p>Then Yoda spoke, "Then over this session is. Master Kit Fisto procedures you know?" Kit nodded at him and Harry and his master left the room. As they were at the door Secura called out to them, "Kit good luck."</p><p>Harry turned to the woman and then looked at his master who nodded back but then Harry grinned as he saw his master's face colour slightly; it looked like his master liked the female Jedi Master as more than a friend.</p><p>As soon as they were out Kit turned to his apprentice, "My young padawan, we have our first proper mission you need to go and pack, but please bring some different coloured clothes, the Jedi have no problem with you dressing like that but king Veruna probably will. So just bring something different and bring some rations, just in case. I will meet you at the transport area in half an hour."</p><p>Harry nodded and ran to his quarters. He was finally getting a proper mission after six months. He entered his quarters and packed his extra clothes, his spare cloak and spare boots. Then he grabbed his equipment to put in his belt: a Husk-98 comlink, a grappling hook, aqua breather, holoprojector and rations. Then he made sure his lightsaber was still attached to his belt, picked up his bag and was almost out before he remembered something.</p><p>He dropped his bag and ran to his bedside cabinet and opened a drawer. Inside was the necklace he had gotten from the universe he had come from. He picked it up and threw it round his neck. It was a bit small but not uncomfortably so. He decided he would make it bigger on the way, he picked up his bag again took one last look around his quarters and headed out.</p><p>Harry walked to the transport area and was expecting to find his master waiting by the Jedi star fighters but when he got to the hangar he found it empty. So he closed his eyes and reached tried to sense his master. He found him quickly and saw him waiting by the cruisers. He ran over to him.</p><p>When Kit Fisto saw his padawan he was relieved, he had forgotten to tell him they wouldn't be flying themselves to Naboo and were going on the Radiant VII. He quickly explained why they were going by transport. The reason was they didn't want to look threatening, when he was satisfied that his padawan had everything he needed they stepped onto the ship.</p><p>Once on board and the luggage was put away they met the pilots who told them they would be going into light speed so the journey would not take very long, but there was a drink and food area at the back where they could get something to eat from.</p><p>Harry and Kit sat at a table and tried to do some meditating. But then Harry remembered something he wanted to ask his master. He looked at him and saw he was not having much luck meditating and figured he could ask him now.</p><p>"Master do you have feelings for Aayla Secura?"</p><p>Kit instantly knew by "feelings" Harry meant fancy, or love and he got a faint red tinge across his green skin. Harry knew what that meant and although he found it funny he was concerned for his master.</p><p>"But master Fisto attachment is forbidden."</p><p>Kit Fisto nodded, "Don't you think we know that?" He said in a hushed voice, "The council figured it out too, pretty much everyone knows, they said so long as we never acted on our feelings we would be okay. Harry, take my advice, never fall in love as a Jedi, it is torture having to ignore your feelings okay? Aayla and I get by, but only because we both know the feeling is mutual. If I didn't it would drive me mad so just be careful alright?"</p><p>Harry could see the concern etched in his master's face and deep in his black eyes. Harry nodded, "Okay master, I understand. I am gonna take a look around."</p><p>Harry stood up stretched drained his Juri juice, and took a walk. Halfway round he was delighted to find a mini fitness centre. He turned on the treadmill (<strong>couldn't think of a star wars name for it) </strong>and set at a reasonably fast jogging speed and started to run. He set the distance to two thousand five hundred metres and started the clock.</p><p>An hour and twenty-five minutes later Harry was soaked in sweat, his heart was pumping fast and he felt wide-awake. He quickly showered off the sweat as the pilot announced that they would be landing soon. So he walked out dressed in a white Jedi tunic and trousers and a cream cloak, much to his master's happiness that he had changed his normal colour scheme of black.</p><p>They picked up their bags and strapped themselves into the seats as the transport started its descent. Finally it landed and Harry and his master stepped into the lush planet that was Naboo.</p><p>A guard came out and shook their hands, "Greetings Jedi, my name is captain Panaka. I will show you to your rooms and then the king requests to talk to you, Master Fisto, this way please."</p><p>As they walked through the Theed palace's front garden, Harry admired the plants and the trees. The multitude of bright colours; green, blue, purple, red, gold, white and yellow from the plants intertwined with the orange of the sunset and Harry decided they looked beautiful. There were plant archways and trees with all kinds of fruit with benches on either side of a gravel path that crunched underfoot had a strange beauty and the noises of the birds were very peaceful.</p><p>Harry received another shock when he was shown his room. The quarters at the temple were plain and identical to each other in every way. The room he saw in front of him, however, was amazing; the walls were a deep red colour and the carpet was soft, the ceiling was high and the glass-pained windows went all the way up to the ceiling. The bed was even better. It was a four-poster with a thick red duvet and the softest mattress Harry had ever felt. The pillows were big and fluffy. The room was also spacious and had more storage space than five padawan quarters put together. In the corner were a few soft armchairs and a sofa around a fire, which was crackling merrily, casting a soft glow around the room. Harry decided he was going to love living here.</p><p>Harry unpacked the few things he had brought. He put his tunics on the shelves and put his trousers in the trunk at the end of the bed. He unclipped his utility belt and put it on the cabined next to the bed and then took off his tunic and put on his undershirt before moving to sit in front of the fire. He knew his master would want to speak to him and he waited patiently.</p><p>Ten minutes later, there was a knock at his door and in stepped Kit. He sat next to Harry and quickly explained what the King had talked to him about. "Harry I recommend you spend most of your days in the back palace garden. I saw it on my way here, the king has kindly said you can take a run through it each day and has allowed us a room in which to train. If you are going to ask how long we will be here, I don't know but it will be after the elections take place so at least two months."</p><p>Harry grinned. Two months, he could live with that.</p><p>Kit continued, "Well my young padawan, if that is everything I suggest you go to bed. I will see you tomorrow." With that, Kit stood up and walked out briskly. Harry put the fire out and collapsed into the softest bed he had ever felt and was asleep within minutes.</p><p>Harry woke the next morning to the feeling of the sun streaming through the windows and he heard the birds sing outside. Harry got out of bed and looked out of one of the many windows. He saw the garden his master had mentioned earlier and liked the look of it. Unlike the one at the front of the palace it did not have many exotic plants, but was a large expanse of luscious, bright green grass, with a large lake glimmering in the sunlight beside it. Harry pulled on a fresh undershirt and trousers and decided to go for a run around the lake.</p><p>Harry stepped outside his room and let the clean, fresh, morning air whip his skin. He then walked off into the garden, nodding at the people he saw. Most of them looked like quite wealthy people but there were guards too. After a while he reached the edge of the lake and started to jog.</p><p>Harry now sat by the lake at a quiet edge away from everyone else. He had his belt clipped on but he and his master had decided that it was too hot to wear tunics too. After he had finished his run he had showered quickly and had dressed in a clean undershirt and had had a quick breakfast. Following that, he had taken a quite walk in the garden. He had found this quite spot and had decided to take advantage of it. Coruscant was never this quiet and he had decided this would be a great place to meditate.</p><p>Harry sat by the lake, letting his body open itself and feel the force flow through it. His master and Master Yoda had warned him not to go completely out of himself a lot so he kept in the sounds of his surroundings. He had never been in a place as easy to meditate as this before. Then he felt someone's presence and it was no one he knew. He decided to wait and see who it was. Then he heard a soft voice that Harry quickly decided was more beautiful than any palace garden in the world.</p><p>"Hello?" the voice questioned.</p><p>Harry opened his eyes and quickly stood up and looked at the person in front of him. She was about thirteen, same age as Harry maybe a bit older, dressed in a simple blue dress. She had long brown hair that went right down her back and contrasted well with her cream coloured skin and then he looked into her eyes; they were the brown and very soft. Harry was in awe, sure, there were girls at the temple but this girl–no, woman, was something different.</p><p>"Hello milady," said Harry respectfully and he bowed to her.</p><p>She giggled slightly and curtseyed back, "Please just call me Padme, Padme Naberrie."</p><p>Padme, Harry thought, he had never heard such an amazing name before in his life. Then she spoke again.</p><p>"So what's your name?"</p><p>Harry cleared his throat, "Oh, sorry Padme, my name's Harry, Harry Potter."</p><p>She nodded when he said his name, "Harry I have never seen you around here before."</p><p>Harry grinned, as the two sat down on the grass next to the lake and he responded, "No, you wouldn't have. I only got here last night, I am here with my master I am a Jedi padawan. So, I take it you live here? It's very nice, very peaceful and I don't think I have ever seen anything more beautiful." Of course Harry was lying, Padme was the most beautiful sight in the world and nothing could beat that.</p><p>Padme gasped; she had met on of the legendary guardians of the galaxy! Then she blushed at the praise he gave her home world, "Yes I have lived here all my life I love it here like you said it is very beautiful, but you're a Jedi that is amazing."</p><p>Harry sighed slightly, "It can be Padme, and some parts are; the sense of achievement I feel when I complete are hard assignment or when I passed my padawan tests to become a padawan was amazing. But it is a hard life, especially learning to let go of all emotions and then control yourself so you don't let emotions take control."</p><p>Padme looked confused, "What do you mean let go of emotion and what other things make it hard?"</p><p>Harry sighed and thought of a way to explain it, "Ok, say somebody wanted something but for whatever reason they couldn't have it, but somebody else could what would they feel?"</p><p>Padme looked surprised but answered easily, "Jealousy, anger and hatred of the person."</p><p>Harry nodded, "Exactly. Hatred, anger and jealousy are three main things that lead to the Dark Side of the Force. As Jedi, we use the force for peace whereas the Dark Side uses it for power. To prevent Jedi from falling victim to the Dark Side by feeling these emotions the Jedi have to let go of them all even the good ones such as love, so the Jedi are forbidden to create attachments to people and love is forbidden."</p><p>Padme was shocked beyond belief, "You can't love?"</p><p>Harry shook his head, "All attachment is forbidden, that's why we are taken away from our parents normally from about two months so we don't know them and can't form attachments and like I said, to do this we have to let go of all emotion. As the masters say attachment is not the Jedi way."</p><p>Padme felt sad for the young man sitting in front of her and badly wanted to say something that would make it better but she knew she couldn't. She decided to change the subject. "Harry how else is it hard, being a Jedi I mean?"</p><p>Harry smiled; this would be a long explanation, "Well Padme, all Jedi live their life by the Jedi code which outlines the life of a Jedi it goes like this; Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy. Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others. Jedi respect all life, in any form. Jedi serve others, rather than rule over them, for the good of the galaxy. Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training. Basically we have to spend our lives serving the Jedi and yes it can be rewarding, but living your life by the rules it is hard to avoid temptation and not think of the free life you could have, but that's another way to be tempted to the dark side."</p><p>Padme nodded, "Is there anything else?"</p><p>Harry nodded, "The training can be tough, we have to learn lightsaber combat and we have to keep fit, and learning the force–" to demonstrate he skipped a rock across the lake without touching it "–when I was younger was hard too."</p><p>Then Padme changed the subject again, "Harry can you tell me how you grew up with the Jedi?"</p><p>Harry smiled. This girl sure was curious. "Well I came to the Jedi at just over a year old and that is old for a youngling to be accepted but due to my high power they accepted me into the Jedi temple to learn the ways of the Jedi. When I was three I joined a clan of other younglings my age and we stayed together for nine years. As the years passed I learnt more about ways of the Jedi; such as the code, the layout of the galaxy, lightsaber combat, using and changeling the force and stuff like that. As I said before, attachment is forbidden, one place that attachment is accepted is within youngling clans as the council know it is unavoidable. Well our clan bonded pretty quickly, but I have three best friends called, Dez, Yux and Prelo. I am a little closer to Dez though. Then after I had learnt everything I could as a youngling I took my padawan trials and passed and Kit Fisto became my master. I built my lightsaber and went on a few missions with him and yesterday we were told to come here so we did and well here I am." He finished with a cheeky grin.</p><p>Padme was awed by how much this young man had told her. Then he spoke again, "Well Padme enough about me, what's it like living here on Naboo?"</p><p>She blushed, "Well, I live with my mum and dad and my older sister Sola and I love living here. I went to school here and hoped to become a politician but I am hoping to be elected queen in the coming elections!"</p><p>Harry was shocked! She surely couldn't be much older than him. His expression must have shown his shock because she quickly said, "Harry please don't think you have to treat me differently than what you are doing now. Ever since I became a candidate, everyone has been treating me like somebody special. It is nice to be able to sit and talk to you because you treat me like a normal person".</p><p>Harry smiled, "Ok Padme, don't worry, I won't treat you differently."</p><p>Then a bell chimed from somewhere and Padme looked sad, "Harry I have to go, it has been really nice to talk to you."</p><p>Harry nodded, "Same for me Padme could we talk again sometime?"</p><p>Padme smiled, "Harry I would love to."</p><p>Harry was relieved he stood up and gave her a hand up. He stuck out his hand but Padme shook her head. She batted his and away and wrapped her arms around him in a hug. At first Harry was stunned but then hugged her back, he knew he shouldn't but he couldn't help it. Padme let go, "Bye Harry, talk to you tomorrow, here at the same time?"</p><p>Harry nodded, "Padme I would love to." Padme smiled in response at him and walked off.</p><p>Harry watched her go. He had just told her basically his life story and yet it had been so easy to do. He felt the necklace and knew that the only thing he had not told her about was how he came to this galaxy. She was an amazing girl and Harry instantly thought, <em>'No attachment is not the Jedi way you are only going to be here for a while then you will leave and never see her again, we are friends nothing more.'</em> Harry walked off and, for the first time, he doubted following the Jedi code. As he walked to his room he convinced himself that they were friends and nothing more. But whenever he thought of her, he felt so happy, it was a happiness he had never felt about anyone before. He collapsed down on his bed furiously working to keep his mind from thinking about how beautiful, funny and nice she was.</p><p>Deep down, however, Harry knew that he had formed a deeper attachment to Padme then he had anyone else.</p><p><em>A/N: So Harry has met Padme how will this leave him feeling about the Jedi order and what will happen to them during this mission. One word this will not be a Sith Harry story and for the moment Harry and Padme will be friends but will admit their feelings before Anakin and Padme did in the prequel series.</em></p><p><em>As always please review</em></p>
