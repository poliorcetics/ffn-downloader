<h1>6. Chapter 6</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Harry woke up in his room on Naboo with the sun shining through the windows and hearing the various birds sing; just like every other day on the mission.</p><p>However, Harry didn't feel like getting up. His body was flooded with hot, fresh guilt. The kiss with Padme yesterday was weighing him down and it was breaking his heart trying to forget it. He was also worried about the consequences that could come if anyone found out about it. He groaned slowly and pulled the duvet up over his head and snuggled back down, burying his head in the pillows. He knew his master wouldn't like him sleeping in, but right now Harry couldn't care less. He closed his eyes and the heat from the sun and from his thick duvet quickly lulled him back to sleep.</p><p>Kit Fisto was angry; in fact he was beyond angry he was fuming! His Padawan had not shown up at breakfast. At first Kit had thought Harry had gone for an early run or something. But as he was walking through the gardens trying to find Harry one of the passing guards had said he hadn't left his room all morning.</p><p>So Kit had stormed off to Harry's quarters and was now standing outside the door. He used a powerful force push and the door flew open allowing him to walk into the room. What he saw made him even angrier; Harry was lying in bed, the duvet wrapped around him and his head was underneath two pillows.</p><p>Kit raised his hand and, using the force, slowly raised the mattress into the air before tipping it over as quick as lightning. Harry fell to the ground and landed with a loud <em>thump</em>.</p><p>Harry sat up as though he had been zapped with ten thousand bolts of force lightning and saw his master looming over him. "Nice to see you up my young Padawan, although it is rather late. I believe this deserves punishment and I believe in the days we have been here you have only been doing a little running and meditating." He stopped speaking and threw Harry his trousers, tunic, undershirt, boots and lightsaber. "Get dressed and meet me outside," He growled, "Five minutes." And he walked out to allow Harry some privacy.</p><p>Harry sprinted across the castle gardens and broke off the trail near the lake, deciding to run across the open grassland that took up the majority of the vast acres of land. It was a boiling hot day and his black tunic over an undershirt didn't help him stay cool either. Sweat was pouring down his bright red face and his short hair was sticking to his forehead. He had already run thirteen miles and still had another five to go. He now seriously regretted lying in that morning.</p><p>He staggered through the last one hundred yards but soon found out he was far from over. As soon as Harry was back to his master he was dragged into a small room with a single mat in the middle. Kit told him to sit down and looked at him an evil smile on his face, "Harry as you had a little lie in today I think a bit more exercise is in order, hit the deck sixty, sixty, sixty."</p><p>Harry groaned that meant sixty press ups, sixty sit-ups and sixty squats. On a normal day he would do this easily but not after running eighteen miles ten minutes before. Harry lay down on his back bent his knees and started on his sit-ups. When he started doing press ups it was harder because Kit was pressing a boot into his back.</p><p>Harry managed though but after the last press up he collapsed down on the mat completely and totally exhausted. Kit pulled his boot from his back and spoke, "Well Harry, I have to say I'm impressed, you showed determination right there. Now get back to your room and shower. The king has kindly invited us to dine with him tonight at an elections debate so I want you on your best behaviour, and put on your white tunic."</p><p>Harry nodded got up slowly and walked back to his room. As he left the room he instantly pulled off his tunic and undershirt and started walking back in the direction of his room. He then heard a shout behind him with a voice he would recognise anywhere "Harry, wait a moment."</p><p>Harry turned around and saw Padme running up to him. If Harry wasn't exhausted he would of felt her presence in the force, but he was so worn out he doubted he would of sensed a Bantha if they were native to Naboo. As she got up to him her face flushed a deep red and Harry (after a few seconds of thinking) knew why. He was <em>shirtless </em>in front of a possible queen for galaxies sake. Padme looked up at him her face very red and spoke, "Harry, I have an elections dinner tonight and I have to prepare for it so I can't see you today, I'm sorry."</p><p>Harry smiled, "Don't worry Padme, me and my master have been invited to the dinner by the king so I will see you tonight."</p><p>Padme cracked a huge smile and went to hug him but stopped herself and said, "That's great Harry, see you later." Harry nodded. Then as they were about to walk off Harry quickly said, "Oh and Padme I am sorry about my lack of clothing," pointing to his bare chest.</p><p>Padme blushed again and said, "It's okay Harry it was an accident." Harry nodded and they walked off.</p><p>Padme walked across the gardens of Naboo and sat in her favourite spot by the lake. She knew she should be getting ready for her speech but her mind was in a whirlwind. She knew she had kissed him yesterday and she blushed from the memory. She had forced herself to restrain from hugging him a minute ago. Then she felt a blush creep up her cheeks as she remembered his thin but muscular upper body. She had admitted to herself that she had a crush on the boy but refused to go any deeper than that, for both of their sakes.</p><p>But now as she stared into the lake remembering the feeling evoked from the kiss earlier and the sheer happiness she got from just being near him and talking to him. She also thought about the sadness she got from knowing that he would have to leave one day. It was then that she admitted she had fallen in love with a Jedi. She buried her head in her hands and while she wasn't crying, her body was shaking which made it clear she was sobbing quietly. She loved Harry, a Jedi! It could never work and this was the only person she had ever loved.</p><p>She had had a crush before on a boy called Palo, which she thought was love. But that was nothing compared to what she was feeling about Harry. She didn't know feelings for somebody could go this deep; it seemed impossible. She cursed all the stress she was under which was causing her to react like this. She took a deep breath and steadied herself. She knew if she wanted to be queen she would have to be strong, and ignore her personal feelings and do what was best for Naboo. She stood up took a deep breath and walked back to the house.</p><p>Meanwhile Harry had taken a shower and had taken a walk round the castle garden. Right now he was sitting by the lake meditating, trying to calm down. It was great meditating on Naboo. Coruscant was never this quiet and now feeling the cool breeze in his face and hearing the birds sing and listening to the rustle of the trees. The sunset was a sight to behold. It was making the sky appear a bright orange with a slight pink tinge, shining over the lake making it give of waves of bright light. Harry had hardly ever felt more at peace then he did now. He was letting the force flow through his body, making him feel powerful and strong. It was as though his body was weightless and the air was flowing right through his body.</p><p>Then as he was feeling the living force go through his mind there was a huge disturbance, and he came quite literally crashing back down to Naboo. He opened his eyes and felt nothing like how he was meant to feel at the end of meditating. He jumped up and sprinted off to find his master.</p><p>Harry arrived at his master's room and knocked and the door opened instantly. Kit looked down and there was clear surprise on his face as he saw his Padawan. "Harry what are you doing here?"</p><p>Harry looked up (even though he was almost as tall as his master), "Master I have a bad feeling about something going on tonight, I was meditating down by the lake and I felt a big disturbance in the force. Something about the mission."</p><p>Kit looked concerned and used the force himself. Then he too felt the disturbance. He looked at Harry and called him in. They moved to sit down together by the fire in the room. Kit spoke up again as they settled, "Harry I felt it too, I think your right something is going to happen tonight. We need to be prepared for anything, bring your lightsaber and use the force and be wary of your surroundings. We need to be alert; if tonight goes wrong there could be heavy casualties and the whole mission could be over and I hate to think about the trouble that would cause."</p><p>Harry nodded and walked out of the room deep in thought, he knew who he would keep an eye on like a hawk on tonight.</p><p>Harry walked into the big room and instantly felt intimidated. He was easily the youngest person here and felt like a child in a grown up world. There were hundreds of small round tables set around the big room. There were waiters wondering around, and at the end there was a long table which had a few chairs set up behind. In the middle was a gold chair that Harry knew was for the king. He looked up at his master beside him and Kit directed them to a table near the front of the room. There was a podium in front of the top table that Harry assumed was reserved for the people who were standing for the new position of ruler.</p><p>As the two sat down, Harry noticed three empty seats near them and wondered who they were for. He took off his cloak and looked at himself on the highly polished wooden table. He had made an attempt to flatten his hair and it had worked somewhat, it was a bit flatter than normal, and the fact he had put it in his braid helped. He was in his best white tunic, with cream trousers and black boots. He had his cloak with him but he had hung it on his chair.</p><p>A waiter came over and asked what they would like to drink. Kit ordered a Fozbeer. Harry decided to go for a Bubblezap. The waiter thanked them and they moved off to place the orders.</p><p>Harry looked over the tables and saw them gradually filling up. He looked up at the top table and saw a few men and a beautiful, heavily made up woman sitting there. Her face was carefully made up and she had her dark hair tied up into a knot at the back of her head. She was wearing a red dress that was lined with gold and had a black neckline. She had bracelets on her wrists and had a ring on her finger. Harry looked straight into her eyes: they were a dark brown. It was then that his suspicions were confirmed; it was Padme. When she saw him she gave him a big smile and Harry smiled back. He <em>loved </em>her smile.</p><p>His focus was disrupted when heard the scraping of chairs and he looked up and saw three people sitting down. There were two adults and a girl who looked like she was in her late teens. They smiled kindly to the two Jedi and the man spoke, "Good evening my name is Ruwee Naberrie; this is my wife Jobal and my eldest daughter Sola."</p><p>Harry smiled. These were Padme's parents and her sister. When he looked at Sola he could see similarities between her and Padme that only siblings could have. He reached over and shook Ruwee's hand before, after a nod from his master, he kissed Jobal's hand and then pressed his hands together and bowed his head to Sola. His master did the same then Kit spoke, "Good evening sir, milady's. I am Jedi master Kit Fisto and this is my apprentice, Harry Potter."</p><p>The shock on the Naberrie's faces nearly made Harry burst out laughing but a sharp look from his master made him quiet down. However they were all shocked for different reasons. Ruwee was shocked that there were Jedi on Naboo as they were only there when they needed to be. Sola was shocked that she had met the galaxy guardians and Jobal was more shocked then the two of them put together. She had, had her suspicions about the young boy sitting there, that he was the Jedi Padme was talking about, but this confirmed it. When she looked at him she saw Padme's description of him was largely correct. She knew she would have to talk to him later if she could.</p><p>After this, the group talked about things, mostly stuff to do with being a Jedi, which were asked mostly by Sola. The drinks came along and Jobal came to the decision that she wouldn't mind if this boy returned her daughter's feelings, even if it couldn't happen or work. He was funny, mature, had a great deal of respect for everyone and generally seemed like a good person. She especially liked it when he accepted the toast to her daughter that was raised when the Naberrie's drinks came along.</p><p>Then the door opened and everybody stood up as guards started to enter the room. Kit stood up and gestured for Harry to do so too. As the guards came in, a band was playing and as they walked to the middle table, Harry realised it was the King in the midst of them. He stood in front of the throne and greeted the audience; "Ladies and gentlemen it is my great pleasure to welcome you to this dinner event. I hope it is very enjoyable for all of you and this helps you make the right decision when it comes to the elections in two weeks." He sat down on the throne and struck up a conversation with a senator.</p><p>Then the waiters started coming round and taking orders for food. When it had all been given out, the room was in a jovial mood. The atmosphere was happy, there was a buzz of chatter and the clink of cutlery and glasses the food was also delicious. Harry enjoyed learning more about life on Naboo, from the Naberrie's and they wanted to learn as much about his life as he did theirs.</p><p>When the plates had been cleared away the king stood up again. "Now that we are all fed the talks can begin."</p><p>It was absolute craziness! The king had turned very aggressive in his talk. Saying they needed to squeeze the planets resources and cut down the forests and drain and mine the lakes. He was also suggesting killing all the native creatures.</p><p>Needless to say the guests were fuming. They were screaming threats and booing. The guards had already had to fight back a few protestors. The king was still shouting "WE WON'T BECOME A RICH, BOLD PLANET WITHOUT MAKING SACRIFICES. YES I WOULD MISS THE PLANET'S RESOUCRCES BUT IT IS NECESARRY!" This was met by more boo's and more people trying to harm him. Kit looked at Harry and they nodded and tightened their grips on their hilts,</p><p>Then the king stood down and the old man stood up facing the public with Padme and a few others standing behind him. "Good evening I am senator Palpatine, the king has been in office for a while now and nothing has changed. The blockade over this planet is becoming more dangerous and I think action needs to be taken now. I am calling for a vote of no confidence in the kings leadership!"</p><p>This statement was met by cheers and shouts of, "VOTE NOW! VOTE NOW!"</p><p>The senator spoke again, "Very well the vote shall take place."</p><p>Then a man stood up, "No you just want the girl in power and she won't do what's right whereas the king will." And with that he pulled a small blaster out and shot it at Padme.</p><p>Horror coursed through Harry's veins. Time seemed to move in slow motion as the shot moved. He stood up feeling the force flow through him and he leapt through the air. His lightsaber flew into his hand and he ignited the blade; as he landed, he deflected the shot off the blade. The shot went back and hit the man's blaster out of his hands.</p><p>Silence filled the hall, dreadful, shocked silence. Several people's mouths were wide open. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Then Kit knew he had to do something and he stood up. He shouted, "Guards, arrest that man." The guards knew that Kit was a Jedi and they obeyed him and they dragged the man out of the hall.</p><p>The guards had just made it outside the room when several people jumped up and started pulling out blasters and firing them. Shots bounced around the room, smashing the tables, and nearly hitting a few people. The people were screaming and the king shouted for more guards. Kit and Harry stood with their lightsabers, blocking the shots made. As more back up came into the room they just started fighting against the guards that were fighting for the people of Naboo. Kit turned to Harry, "Harry get as many people out of here as you can, me and whatever guards there are left can handle this for now, but get back as soon as you can."</p><p>Harry nodded and jumped down to the tables. He was beckoning anyone found to come with him. As he ran some shots came near him but he easily blocked them. Harry found it horrible; he was witnessing true death for the first time, as people were dropping all around him. Eventually, he had a crowd of people behind him as he got to the main entrance. When he tried the door it was locked. He tried using force to open it but nothing worked. Losing his patience, he ignited his blade again and slammed it into the door. He dragged the blade in a circle and kicked out the cut part of the door. "GO NOW"! He shouted to the people behind him. They didn't need telling twice and they scrambled through it.</p><p>Then he heard a frantic voice behind him. He turned and found it was Jobal. When she saw him she ran to him. "Harry, Padme is still in there, we lost her when we were following you, please find her?"</p><p>Harry was already moving before she finished speaking and sprinted back into the room. He dodged the shots from the blasters and used the force to find her, and he found her very quickly. She was firing a blaster she had picked up from a dead guard. He admired her skill. Then he nearly had a heart attack! A man with an electrostaff had hit the blaster out of her hand and knocked her to the ground. Harry quick as a flash jumped through the air with his lightsaber ignited. As the guard was about to strike, he landed in front of Padme, and kicked the man back.</p><p>The man came back wielding the staff and Harry could instantly tell that he had never used one before. He adopted a fighting stance and used form three of combat. As the guard struck down on Harry's blade, Harry easily countered and the man staggered. Harry easily struck his blade through the man's chest and he collapsed forward dead.</p><p>Harry turned around and helped Padme up and she gave him a tight hug. Harry smiled uneasily and pulled her off of him and said, "Padme c'mon, we have to get you out of here."</p><p>Padme nodded and Harry handed her a blaster before the pair started moving through the room. They moved quickly between the tables and Harry blocked any shots that came near them. They quickly made it to the door and they went through the hole and Padme was quickly brought into her mother's arms and Harry sprinted back into the room.</p><p>Harry blocked any shot he could and fought near his master. As soon as he was next to him they dominated the battle. Harry used his agility and speed to his advantage. When he didn't block a shot he dodged it quickly and then he attacked.</p><p>Along with help from the few guards that were on their side, the fight was finished quickly and they all stood there taking deep breaths. Harry looked at his master and they de-activated their lightsabers and the guards took this as their cue to holster their weapons. Harry looked around the room; it was completely wrecked. The tables were all turned over and most of them were broken, lights had been broken and some were hanging from the ceiling, the chandelier had smashed to the floor, causing thousands of tiny pieces of glass to shower around the room. Most of the windows were broken and there were bodies all over the room.</p><p>Then a guard stepped up and Harry recognised him as Captain Panaka who beckoned them all out of the room. When they stepped out they were met by a group of politicians. Harry recognised Palpatine and a few other men he had seen on the table and he saw Padme standing at the back with her family. Then Palpatine turned to look at Harry, "Well that was utter chaos, but my boy you did extremely well. We estimate that you saved over two hundred lives." Then he turned to Kit Fisto, "Master Jedi, you must be very proud of your apprentice. Most people his age would have not as kept such a cool head and gone back in when he could have stayed out."</p><p>Kit smiled slightly, "I told him what to do and he listened, Jedi are meant to do that. But I am proud of how calm he stayed when he did what I told him to do. Most padawans wouldn't have kept that calm on their first mission if they were presented with this sort of situation."</p><p>Harry smiled, "Thank you sir, master."</p><p>Then another politician spoke, "So Jedi, Panaka do you have any idea of what happened to cause the violence?"</p><p>Panaka spoke, "All we know is that the king is nowhere to be found and he was the one that called in the tyrant guards as well as being the main cause for the violence."</p><p>Then a guard came in and said, "The king has vanished. We looked around the whole castle and we can't find him."</p><p>Harry looked at his master his eyes wide, he knew they were all thinking the same thing, if the king called it the tyrant guards, and then vanished it looked like he had planned all of this to happen so he could stay as king.</p><p>Then Panaka looked at the group, "If the king did mean for this to happen, he could be working for the trade federation, he needs to be found." He turned to Kit, "Master Jedi, could you start a lookout for the king, I will place any of my guards you require at your service."</p><p>Kit grimaced slightly, "I will have to talk to the Jedi council tomorrow. Once they hear about this they will decide on mine and Harry's future and if we are to stay here. If they allow us to stay I will gladly start a search for your king but my Padawan will stay here if that happens."</p><p>Harry's eyes widened in horror! He didn't want to leave Naboo he loved it here, of course there was another reason he wanted to stay but soon he was kicking himself. <em>No I know I am going to have to leave eventually, and yes it will hurt but being a Jedi is my life</em>.</p><p>Then Palpatine spoke, "Very well, we will decide on what is to be done about a ruler tomorrow, right now I would like to retire to my chambers. Goodnight."</p><p>The rest of the politicians seemed to agree and bade the others goodnight and walked off with a few guards. Panaka turned to the two Jedi after the others left, "Master Jedi, please inform me of the council's decision in the morning. Master Jedi, young Padawan, goodnight." He turned on his heels and walked off briskly, his deputies trailing behind him.</p><p>The pair watched them go before Harry turned to his master, "Well we were right about something bad happening, but I had no idea it would be this bad."</p><p>Kit shook his head, "No, I didn't either, this will be a crisis. I need to talk to the council at once, they will decide on the future of our mission. I would pack tonight Harry, we may have to leave in the morning!"</p><p>Harry felt a huge wave of sadness rise in him but fought back tears. He nodded and Kit bade him goodnight before walking off to his quarters. Harry slowly turned around and started to walk outside to get to his room but heard a shout behind him.</p><p>"Harry, please wait a moment."</p><p>Harry turned to see Padme's family walking towards him. He smiled at them and walked towards them. As soon as he was there Jobal engulfed him in a hug nearly cracking his ribs. When she let go, Harry saw she had moist eves and she started to dab them with a handkerchief. When she had dry eyes she looked at Harry she started to speak, "Harry we wanted to thank you. You saved are daughter's life twice tonight our family owes you a debt we can never repay, thank you, thank you."</p><p>Then she buried her head in her husband's shoulder and started to cry. Ruwee smiled and gently wrapped an arm around his wife and stuck his hand out, "Harry my wife said it all; all we can say is thank you. If it wasn't for you our daughter would be dead now. Thank you Harry for saving my daughter." And he clasped Harry's hand in his.</p><p>Then Padme came hurrying forward and pulled Harry into a hug that rivaled her mothers, "Harry thank you I owe you my life."</p><p>Harry laughed quietly and hugged her back, and then he whispered in her ear, "We need to talk later, our spot, one hour." She nodded and moved out of his arms. Then he looked at the family seriously.</p><p>"Mr. Naberrie, milady, you don't owe me anything and Miss Padme, you especially don't owe me your life. I was doing my duty and I would do it a million times over. I wouldn't want to, as that would mean she was in danger, but I would. I am sorry for the violence that occurred tonight but I assure you it is in good hands to sort it out."</p><p>Ruwee nodded, "Very well Harry, we will take your word on it. Goodnight."</p><p>Harry bade goodnight to them and mouthed <em>later, </em>to Padme and walked outside to the castle garden to his room. He flung himself down on his bed and punched his pillow. He didn't want to leave and he didn't know how Padme would take it that he could leave. He swore loudly into his pillow and sat up. He pulled of his white tunic and belt; he pulled his hair out of the braid. Then he walked into his bathroom, to shower off the sweat he got from the fight. When he got out he pulled on a black undershirt and black trousers. He clipped his belt back on and grabbed his lightsaber; after tonight he wasn't taking any chances. Then after braiding his hair again quickly and lacing up his boots, he headed out and quietly jogged down to the lake.</p><p>Padme and her family walked into her house on Naboo. She bade goodnight to her parents and went to the bathroom. She washed off her makeup and changed into a simple, plain black dress and let her hair fall down her back. She quietly walked out of her room and was moving into the kitchen when she ran straight into Sola.</p><p>"Oh, hey Padme, I thought you had gone to bed."</p><p>Padme shook her head. She knew she had to lie, "I did, but I got hungry so I came to get something to eat. I didn't eat much tonight because I was nervous and then, well you know what happened."</p><p>Sola nodded, "Yeah I know, crazy huh? Tomorrow's going to be madness, you know, they are calling for an emergency vote for monarch and they are going to hunt for the old king."</p><p>Padme nodded she had heard all of this before coming home.</p><p>"Oh Padme, I know you didn't think of this when he saved you, but he was really cute. I mean he was so noble after saving you, he just said he would do it again and accepted our apology. And with that lightsaber in his hands he just looked dangerous. I mean, when he stood there after blocking that shot at you, he looked quite sexy, I mean that focused determined expression. And his body you could see his muscles, and his hair it was so black and that thing he had it in it was so cute."</p><p>Her sister might not have known it but Padme was seconds away from throttling her sister. How dare she talk about Harry like that! She didn't even know him; fair enough, Padme thought he was <em>incredibly </em>cute. But Padme actually knew Harry and she loved him for who he was. She looked up at Sola and said coolly, "Well Sola it couldn't happen between you two because he is a Jedi and you should know the Jedi law on attachment." With that, she walked out the kitchen and quietly out of the front door with a smirk on her face. Once outside, she ran down to the lake, desperate to see Harry.</p><p>Harry sat in their spot by the lake using the force to throw stones into the lake. He was shivering slightly even though it wasn't a cold night. He wished he had his cloak but he had forgotten about it. Then he heard footsteps in the distance, and then a beautiful voice cut through the air, "Harry?"</p><p>Harry turned around and saw Padme had paused a little ways from him. As soon as she saw his face, Padme ran and flung herself at him. Her arms wrapped around his waist and she buried her head in his chest. Harry for once was not surprised and he pulled her into him and she had no problem with that.</p><p>When they finally let go of each other they sat on the grass. Padme looked straight into Harry's eyes and said, "Harry, I know I said this earlier but thank you so much for saving me earlier."</p><p>Harry blushed slightly, "Padme, please stop thanking me. What was I meant to do sit there and watch you die?"</p><p>Padme smiled slightly, and then saw something that was bothering her, "Harry why are you wearing your hair like that? It looks much better like it was before."</p><p>Harry smiled. Since he had been on Naboo he had not braided his hair, and therefore Padme had not seen it. "It's my Padawan braid, Padawans wear it to help others differentiate them from the Jedi Knights. After a Padawan becomes a graduate, they take it out and can wear their hair however they want."</p><p>Padme smiled slightly, "Well Harry, no offense, but I think your hair looks much better without it."</p><p>Harry smiled, "None taken Padme. I do as well; I am only wearing it at the insistence of my master as the mission is becoming more serious. I have to make my rank clear since we are to represent the Jedi on this planet; although it seems pointless now."</p><p>Padme's eyes widened, "Harry what do you mean by pointless?"</p><p>Harry sighed, "Well Padme, my master and I came here to watch over the trade federation and watch over the elections, but after what has happened and what is going to happen tomorrow… We are not sure if our mission can carry on, we may be going home tomorrow morning."</p><p>Padme's eyes instantly widened and they filled with tears a few seconds later. She instantly ran at Harry and wrapped her arms around him in an enormous hug. Her whole body was shaking with sobs and Harry wrapped her arms around her, as he started to rub her back soothingly.</p><p>After a while Padme pulled her head back and stared into Harry's eyes, his arms were still wrapped around her. Slowly she raised her hand to his hair and slowly undid his braid, as his hair flowed out of it; she gently ran her hands through the messy darkness. Harry gently cupped her cheek and ran his thumb across the smooth skin. Padme was mesmerised by his green eyes and the way his simple touch made her mind turn to mush. Harry put his head down and Padme snaked her arms around him, went up on tip-toes and their lips came together in a gentle but passionate kiss. The feelings the two evoked in the other overwhelmed them. The love, the passion, the raw desire, and just the depth of the feelings for each other made them give themselves into the kiss. Padme had never felt anything like this before; the kiss the day before had been rushed and spur of the moment. She tightened her grip around him and felt Harry do the same to her.</p><p>After about two minutes the need for oxygen made them break apart and Padme looked up at Harry her chocolate brown eyes shining. After she got her breath back she spoke, "Harry, I can't fight this anymore," she said quite angrily. Then she softened, and she spoke in a voice barely above a whisper, "I know if this gets out both our lives are destroyed, but before that happens I want you to know; I love you, truly love you."</p><p>Harry felt like he was dreaming. He of course wanted this but had never dared for this to happen, "Padme, I love you too. I know it sounds crazy because we haven't known each other long and I know I shouldn't but you cannot help who you fall in love with." He looked at her his eyes staring straight into her eyes and spoke in a quiet voice like hers, "I love you Padme." And he went back down and kissed her softly.</p><p>Then she looked at him a sad expression on her face, "I don't want you to leave Harry, promise me you will see me tomorrow before if you do."</p><p>Harry looked at her, "I promise you Padme, on my life, I will see you before I leave tomorrow if I do."</p><p>She looked at him with a slight smile on her face, "Ok Harry I believe you any promise you make is enough for me." She suddenly looked sad, "Harry I better go before my parents notice I am missing." She went up again and kissed him on the cheek, "Goodnight Harry, I love you." Harry kissed her, and they reluctantly went their separate ways, hoping it was only for the night.</p><p><em>A/N: Well there you go they are together. Hope it was good and not to un-believable. Will Harry have to leave tomorrow, or will the new couple get more time together. As always please review</em></p>
