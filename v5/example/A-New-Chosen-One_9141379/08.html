<h1>8. Chapter 8</h1><br/>
<div class='storytext xcontrast_txt nocopy' id='storytext'><P>A/N: A BIG THANK YOU TO MY BETA READER FOR GOING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS! THANK YOU FOR THE REVIEWS AS WELL GUYS, YOU ARE GREAT.</P><P>I know it has been a while but life happened and exams happened but only one left now so time for more writing. This is short I know and I will get a longer one out soon.</P><P>Kit Fisto was beyond worried, he was terrified! His Padawan had been found knocked out on the Naboo wastelands, severely dehydrated and weak. The healer droids at the palace had been unable to find out what had been the cause of him being unconscious in the first place. Kit had contacted the Jedi council for advice and they had told him to stay on the planet. As the threat of the trade-federation was getting bigger all the time, with the blockade in the process of becoming legalised.</P><P>It had been nearly two weeks and while Harry was conscious all he said he could remember was this blue light hitting him. While Kit had his suspicions about what it was, he quickly dismissed it as they were impossible. Harry was still not back to full health. At first he had been slipping in and out of consciousness and had been on medicine for his migraines. However after the first week he had been improving and in the last two days had been taking very light jogs around the castle grounds. However the Medical Droids had been intent on keeping him in. Kit understood why; if Harry fainted or lost consciousness in any way, he could die!</P><P>It was mid-morning and Kit was walking to the medical grounds when he heard a shout. He turned around and saw the Queen approaching. He turned and bowed. She shook her head, "Master Jedi you don't have to bow to me, only my subjects and guards do that. I am not your Queen so you don't have to do that".</P><P>Kit smiled slightly. "Be that as it may your Majesty, I still have to show respect".</P><P>The Queen smiled "Very well. If you are going to see your apprentice today please pass tell him I hope he -,"</P><P>"Get's well soon and tell him I said hello". Kit finished for her. She had said the same thing to him nearly every day now and he was getting curious. She was also constantly asking how Harry was doing, and surely saying well soon once was enough. He had his suspicions about Harry falling for a girl, but surely it was not the Queen! If she did return his feelings, and he got a feeling she did, it could only mean trouble for the both of them.</P><P>He bade the Queen good day and walked on to the medical unit. He walked into Harry's room and found him sitting up in bed with a smile on his face. He grinned more when he saw Kit. "Master Fisto great news, I am getting out of here tomorrow! They ran a few tests yesterday and found out I am fit enough to leave".</P><P>Kit Fisto was very surprised but a quick talk with a Medical Droid confirmed that Harry was telling the truth. "That is good Harry, just remember we are here on a mission, so stick to what we were doing before".</P><P>The next day Harry left the medical ward feeling as good as ever. He no longer had a migraine or felt like he was going to pass out at any second. He went to his room and dropped his bad by the foot of his bed. Then he had a quick change and ran to his master's room. Harry knew that after not doing any training for two weeks he knew that he had to get back to it.</P><P>However when he got to his masters quarters, he found Kit sitting on the chair staring at the floor. "Master"? Harry said to make his presence known.</P><P>Kit Fisto looked at Harry and sighed "Harry the council has decided to send two more Jedi knights onto this mission as our progress was slow".</P><P>Harry looked at his master, shocked. "What do you mean master"?</P><P>Kit looked at him a deadly serious expression on his face. "Our mission was to try and stop the trade federation by negotiating a deal through the new ruler. But it has not worked. The final part of the blockade was legalised last night and all shipping to this planet has stopped. So the council decided to send another team of Jedi posing as ambassadors to force a settlement, to end this madness".</P><P>Harry looked at his master stunned "so basically what they are saying is we have failed".</P><P>Kit nodded grimly. "Yup we couldn't do what they sent us here to do and we took too long. We are going home as soon as the settlement is done, which, hopefully shouldn't take more than a few days".</P><P>Harry sighed. "So I guess we had better start getting ready to leave"?</P><P>Kit sighed too "Yup if the trade federation comply that is. If not this could quickly dissolve into chaos. So just be cautious".</P><P>Harry nodded and walked out of the room. He knew this meant he would have to say goodbye to Padme. He walked through the gardens and down to the lake. He didn't know if she would have time to see him, but if she did he knew he had to tell her.</P><P>Harry sat by the lake for ages. It was getting dark and he was just contemplating going to his room when he felt a familiar presence. He stood up turned around and the next thing he knew he was knocked off his feet by Padme who had launched herself at him. Harry struggled to regain his balance and just put his arms around her.</P><P>They stayed like that for a while. Then eventually Harry kissed her and they sat down. They were content to hold each other after two weeks apart. Then Harry knew what he had to do. He turned to Padme.</P><P>"Padme listen my master told me this morning that the mission is expanding. Two more Jedi are being sent on a mission to stop the trade federation. It does have quite a high success rate so once they are done, I am leaving".</P><P>Padme stared at Harry her eyes wide and shining. Then she turned away and buried her head in her hands. Harry was confused for a second then he saw her body shaking and he realised she was sobbing. So he scooted over to her and pulled her into him. She flowed into his arms and slowly calmed down. Then she looked at him. "Harry if you are leaving promise me one thing".</P><P>Harry looked at her "anything".</P><P>She looked at him her brown eyes shining. She leaned into him and muttered "remember me".</P><P>Harry felt tears come to his own eyes. But he pushed them away and whispered to her, "always".</P><P>Together the two stared out towards the lake, arms wrapped around each other, never speaking and simply making the most of the time they had left.</P><P>A/N:<em>I know it's short, but the next one will be longer and the invasion will start. I know I may have made it sooner than it was in the films but there is a reason for that. Please Review.</em></P>
